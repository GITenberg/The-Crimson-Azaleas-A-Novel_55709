<p class="indent">The singer stopped singing and began to whistle.
Then he broke out into prose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Damn boots! I&#39;ll be lame in another mile. Why
can&#39;t we be content with sandals like our &#39;brithers&#39; the
Japs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinna damn boots, but their makers,&quot; replied his
companion, a sandy Scot of fifty or more, dressed in
broadcloth and a bowler, a figure at once a blot upon
the lonely road and a blasphemy against Japan&mdash;a blot
whose name was M&#39;Gourley. &quot;I vara well remember
when I was in Gleska&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t!&quot; said the poet of the Nikko road, Dick
Leslie by name, a young man, or rather a man still
young, very tall, straight, dark, and good-looking, and
a gentleman from the crown of his close-clipped, curly
black head to the soles of the boots that were torturing
him. &quot;Don&#39;t haul up your factory chimneys, your
smoke and whisky bottles in this place of places. I
believe if a Scot ever gets into heaven he&#39;ll start his first
conversation with his first angel by making some reference
to Gleska: Look there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whaur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot; cried Leslie, turning from the direction of
Fubasami and the beginning of the great Nikko valley
before them, and pointing backwards away towards
Kureise over an expanse of distant country where the
clouds were drawing soft shadows across the rice fields
and the sinuous hills; over little woods of fir and
cryptomeria trees, lakes where the lotus flowers spread in
summer, and the king-fisher flashed like a jewel; over
occasional fields of flowers, flowers that grew by the
million and the million.</p>

<p class="indent">Many of these details were absorbed and dulled by
distance, yet still lent their spirit to the scene, producing
a landscape most strange and quaint.</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly every other country seems flung together by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
nature, but Japan seems to have been imagined by some
great artist of the ancient days&mdash;imagined and constructed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look there,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;saw you ever anything
better than that in Clackmannan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, have I,&quot; replied M&#39;Gourley, contemplating the
view before him, &quot;many&#39;s the time. What sort of
country do you call that? Man! I&#39;d as soon live on a
tea-tray if I had ma choice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you&#39;ve lived in Japan long enough to be used
to it. It&#39;s always the way; put a man in a paradise like
this where there are all sorts of flowers and jolly things
around him, and he starts grumbling and growling and
pining after rain, and misery, and cold, and sleet, and
peat smoke&mdash;if he&#39;s a Scotchman. How long have you
been in Japan, Mac, did you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Near ever since the Samurai took off their swords
and turned policemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What kept you in the East so long if you don&#39;t like
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trade, like the wind, blaweth where it listeth, and a
man must e&#39;en follow his trade,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley; and
they resumed their road.</p>

<p class="indent">They were walking to Nikko together, this strangely
assorted pair, strangely assorted though they were both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Scotchmen. They were approaching the place, not by
that splendid avenue of cryptomeria trees that leads
from Utso-no-Miya, but by the wild hill road, which runs
from Kureise, or rather by the higher hill road, for there
are two, and they had taken the loneliest and the longest
by mistake (M&#39;Gourley&#39;s fault, though he swore that he
knew the country like the palm of his hand).</p>

<p class="indent">They had come twenty or twenty-five miles of the
way by riksha, and were now hoofing the remainder,
their luggage having been sent on to Nikko by train.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And talking of trade,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, &quot;let&#39;s go
back to the matter we were on a moment ago; there&#39;s
money in it, and I know the beesiness. I ken it fine;
never a man knows better the Jap Rubbish trade.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were talking of starting at Nagasaki.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, Nagasaki&#39;s best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll plank the money,&quot; said Leslie. &quot;I&#39;ll put
up a thousand against a thousand of yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley stopped and held out a hand sheathed in
a mournful-looking black dogskin glove.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is&#39;t a bargain?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a bargain. Funny that we should have only met
the other day in Tokyo, and that you should have come
along to Nikko to show me the sights. I believe all the
time you were bent on trepanning me into this business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
&quot;I was that,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, with charming frankness;
&quot;for your own good. A man without a beesiness
is a man astray, and when you told me in the hotel in
Tokyo you were a boddie with money, and nothing to
do with it, I said: &#39;Here&#39;s my chance.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I had met you two months ago,&quot; said Leslie bitterly,
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have been much use, for my father
would not have been dead, and I would not have come
into his money. Do you know what I have been?&mdash;I
have been a remittance man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve met vera much worse people than some of
<i>them</i>,&quot; said Mac, who if his newly found partner had
declared himself a demon out of Hades would perhaps
have made the same glossatory remark&mdash;the capital
being assured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m hanged if I have,&quot; said Leslie bitterly. &quot;Give
me a Sydney Larrikin, a Dago, a Chinee, before your
remittance man. I know what I&#39;m talking about for I
have been one&mdash;see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, may I ask&mdash;&quot; began M&#39;Gourley, then he
paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean what was the reason of my being flung
off by my father? Youthful indiscretions. Let&#39;s sit
down; I want to take my boot off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The road just here took a bend, and became wilder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
and more lovely, a stream gushed from the bank on
which they took their seats, and before them lay a little
valley, a valley hedged on either side by cypress trees,
and thronged with crimson azaleas.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h2">THE BLIND ONE</p>

<p class="indent">Crimson azaleas in wild profusion, here struck
with sun, here shadowed by the cypress trees&mdash;a
sight to gladden the heart of a poet. Between the cypress
trees, beyond the azaleas, beyond country broken
by sunlight and cloud shadows, lay the sea hills of Tanagura
in the dimmest bluest distance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I could get that into a gold frame,&quot; said Leslie,
as he inhaled the delicious perfume of the azaleas and
bathed his naked foot in the tiny cascade breaking from
the bank on which they sat, &quot;I&#39;d take it to London and
send it to the Academy&mdash;and they&#39;d reject it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Vara likely,&quot; replied Mac. &quot;It is no fit for a
peecture. Who ever saw the like of yon out of Japan?
It&#39;s nought but a fakement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;talking of fakements&mdash;in this
business of ours I hope we&#39;ll steer clear of all that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In this beesiness of oors,&quot; said Mac, &quot;I thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
you distinctly understood my friend Danjuro will be
the nominal head of the firrm&mdash;we are but the sleeping
pairtners.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac&#39;s Scotch bubbled in him when he grew excited, or
when he forgot himself. Ordinarily he talked pretty
ordinary English, but when the stopper was off the
Scotch came out, and you could tell by the pronunciation
of the word &quot;money&quot; whether he was mentioning the
article casually or deep in a deal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;I don&#39;t want my dreams troubled
by visions of Danjuro swindling unfortunate tourists;
you say we&#39;re to export things, but I don&#39;t want
to have him roping in people, selling them five-shilling
pagodas at five pounds a-piece.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac sighed as if with regret at the impossibility of
such a delightful deal as that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s rather jolly going into business,&quot; continued
Leslie, dreamily gazing at the azaleas. &quot;Only crime
I&#39;ve never committed, except murder and a few others.
Good God! when I started in life I never thought I&#39;d
end my days peddling paper lanterns, and cheating people
into buying penny-a-dozen kakemonos for a shilling
a-piece. Don&#39;t talk to me; all trade is cheating.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You should have known Macbean,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley,
who had also taken off his boots and stockings and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
was bathing his broad splay feet in the pretty little
torrent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who was he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forty year ago I was his &#39;prentice. Mummies, and
idols, and pagods, and scarabeuses was the output of the
firm, and Icknield Street, Birmingham, its habitation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Idols?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, idols. Some the size of your thumb, and some
the size of bedposts, which they were derived from; some
with teeth, and some with hair, and some bald as a bannock.
We stocked half West Africa with idols, and the
South Seas absorbed the balance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you certainly take the cake,&quot; said Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took three pun ten a week at Macbean&#39;s, and
learnt more eelementary theology than&#39;s taught in the
schules of Edinboro&#39;. Macbean said artistical idols was
what the savages wanted, and what they would get as
long as old bedposteses were to be bought at knockdown
prices, and sold for the waurth of elephants&#39; tusks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You disgust me,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;upon my word you
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s what Macbean said one day to the boddie I
had in mind when I began telling you of this. The
boddie came in grumbling about a mummy&mdash;a vara fine
mummy it was, too&mdash;that had been sold to him for export.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
The mummy had been stuftit with newspapers, but
the <i>sachrum ustum</i> used for coloring the stuffing matter
being omitted, the printed matter remained in eevidence
when the American who bought the article in Cairo
opened it to hunt for amulets and scarabeuses. &#39;Newspapers!&#39;
said Macbean. &#39;And what more do you expect
in a fifty-shullin&#39; mummy? Did y&#39; expect it stuffed wi&#39;
dimonds?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; said Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all, and that&#39;s the whole of beesiness in a
walnut shell; y&#39; canna expect a fifty-shullin&#39; mummy to
be stuffed with&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rubbish! the whole of swindling, you mean. Anyhow,
we&#39;ll keep straight, if you please; a fair profit I
don&#39;t mind, but I object to rank trickery&mdash;by the way,
what&#39;s the time? my watch has stopped; and how far
is Nikko off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s after two,&quot; said Mac, who had no very definite
idea of how far Nikko might be off, having led his companion
by the wrong road and concealed the fact.
&quot;And Nikko is maybe twarree miles, maybe a bit more&mdash;wull
we go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For all answer Leslie took some bar-chocolate from his
pocket, gave some to his companion, and proceeded to
lunch.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
&quot;I daresay you think it funny,&quot; said he at last, &quot;my
chumming up, and in your heart of hearts&mdash;that is,
your business heart (excuse me for being frank)&mdash;you
must think it strange I should put up my money with a
man whom I don&#39;t know in the least. But, man! the
truth of the matter is I&#39;m weary for a friend. I have
money enough and to spare, but&mdash;I&#39;m weary for a
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m the lonest man in the world,&quot; went on Leslie,
munching his chocolate and gazing at the beautiful
scene before him; &quot;the lonest man on God&#39;s earth.
What is the matter with me that I should never have
found and kept a friend? If God had ever given me
anything to love I&#39;d have cherished it, but&mdash;there is no
God that I can see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whisht, man,&quot; said Mac. &quot;Dinna talk like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know I was wild,&quot; went on Leslie, &quot;before I left
England, but other men have been as bad. I quarreled
with my father, but other men&#39;s fathers are different
from what mine was. He drove me beyond the sea to be
an alien and an outcast. I&#39;ve seen drunken loafers in the
bars of Sydney, where I was stuck as a remittance man
three years; they had friends of a sort&mdash;friends who
stuck them, but friend or dog never stuck to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No wumman?&quot; asked M&#39;Gourley, spitting out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
remains of the chocolate he was eating, and lighting a
vile-looking Hankow cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I loved a woman once,&quot; said Leslie, staring before
him with eyes that saw not Japan or the cypress trees
or the azaleas. &quot;Her name was Jane Deering; we were
boy and girl together, cousins, and her people lived
quite close to mine. We got engaged, and were to have
been married, and&mdash;she threw me over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For why?&quot; asked Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Said she didn&#39;t want to get married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that was deefinite.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Damned definite. What&#39;s that noise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tap, tap, tap.&quot; It was the tapping of a stick upon
the ground, and a man in the dress of a coolie, with a
saucer-shaped hat upon his head, turned the corner of
the road, coming in the direction of Nikko. He was
tapping the ground before him with a staff. He was
blind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What an awful-looking face!&quot; said Leslie, as the
figure approached. &quot;Look, Mac! Did you ever see the
like of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One sees many extraordinary and sinister faces in the
East, but the face of the on-comer would have been hard
to match, even in the stews of Shanghai.</p>

<p class="indent">The nose seemed to have been smashed flat by a blow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
The face was flat and possessed an awful stolidity, so
that at a little distance one could have sworn that it was
carved from stone. It impressed one as the countenance
of a creature long in communion with evil.</p>

<p class="indent">The two Scotchmen held motionless to let this undesirable
pass, but he must have possessed some sixth
sense, for instead of passing he stopped and begun to
whine.</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke in a light, flighty, chanting voice, like the
voice of a man either insane or delirious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s he say?&quot; asked Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a Chinee, and wants money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell the beast to go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Says he knows we&#39;re foreigners.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clever that; why, even I can hear your Scotch sticking
out of the gibberish you&#39;re talking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Says he wants opium&mdash;hasn&#39;t had any the whole
day, and if we will give him opium, or money to buy it,
he&#39;ll show us things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord sakes! the creeture&#39;s daft; says he can make
great magic&mdash;snakes out of mud or flowers out of nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why doesn&#39;t he make some opium if he&#39;s so clever?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Says the woods around here are full of devils.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
&quot;Tell him to show us a devil, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac translated and the person so well acquainted with
devils made answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For a piece of gold he will show us one. Why, Leslie,
man, don&#39;t you be a fule.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie had taken half a sovereign from his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give it him and tell him to show us a devil, and if
he plays any tricks I&#39;ll chivy him into Nikko, and give
him up to the police.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be a fule,&quot; said Mac testily. &quot;A&#39;weel!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie put the piece of gold into the creature&#39;s hand,
who put it to his ear for a moment, and then hid it in
his rags. Then he bent his head sideways to the road.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s he doing now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s listening if the road&#39;s clear; he says there&#39;s
nothing on it for two ri on either side, but he hears seven
rikshas coming in the direction of Nikko, but he&#39;ll have
time to do what he wants before they arrive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Blind One bent down rapidly and traced an almost
perfect circle around himself in the dust of the
road; then hurriedly outside this he traced what an initiate
might have taken for the form of the Egg, the
horns of Simara, and another form needless to describe.
Then he said something to Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He says, we&#39;re not to speak, or touch the circle or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
go near it. I have not paid for this entertainment, and
I juist think I&#39;ll take a bit walk doon the road.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down, you old coward,&quot; said Leslie. &quot;I&#39;m the
one that has paid, and I&#39;m the one the &#39;deevil&#39; will
carry off if there is a deevil. Look!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Blind One took from his rags a cane pipe such
as blind men use in Japan, only larger, and began to
blow mournful notes out of it. It was as strange a sound
as ever left human lips, now ear-piercing, now low, low
and soothing; his face flushed and swelled; he seemed enraptured,
entranced with his own music, and the searching
sound of it caused things to move disturbedly in the
trees around, and a low croaking, as if from some feathered
creature disturbed, to come from the cypress wood.</p>

<p class="indent">As he played, he turned north, south, east, and west,
lingering, at last, with the reed pipe pointing between
the cypress trees, as though he were calling to the blue
hills in the distance.</p>

<p class="indent">As he stood thus, Leslie, who had been looking at the
mysterious symbols around the circle, was seized with an
impish impulse, and leaning forward with his walking-stick,
he made in the dust inside the circle, and just behind
the Blind One&#39;s heel, the form of a cross.</p>

<p class="indent">In doing this, the point of the stick touched the Blind
One&#39;s heel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h2">THE LOST ONE</p>

<p class="indent">A congreve rocket incautiously touched by a
match could not have given a more surprising result.</p>

<p class="indent">Flinging the pipe from him with a yell, the Blind
One sprang clear over the circle, and stood for an instant
panting and blowing at the sun.</p>

<p class="indent">He seemed blowing away things that were trying to
enter his mouth; then, the staff attached by a thong to
his wrist flying about wildly, he began to tear at himself
all over his body and fling things away from him, as
though he were attacked by a hundred thousand scorpions;
then as if bitten by some more serious enemy, he
seized his staff, and striking about him wildly, began to
run. Hither and thither, hitting right and left, dashing
against trees and seeming utterly regardless of them,
bleeding, torn, and all the time fighting his phantom pursuers
he ran till he vanished round the bend leading
towards Nikko. The two Scotchmen ran to the bend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
the road, and there down the road they saw him still running,
and fighting as if for his life; striking above him
as if at things in the air, and around him as if at things
leaping at him from the ground. Suddenly he vanished
round a further bend, and was lost to view.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s gone gyte!&quot; said Mac as they returned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m damned!&quot; said Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I touched his heel, and I suppose he thought it was
one of the devils&mdash;mad fool!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis no madness,&quot; said Mac. &quot;If ever I saw a man
chased by deevils I&#39;ve seen one now. &#39;Twas that mark
you made let them loose, or my name&#39;s not Tod M&#39;Gourley.
Did you no ken you were makin&#39; the sign of the
cross in yon damned circle of his? Hech, man! <i>Look
there!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My God!&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, &quot;look you there, <i>there</i>!
There&#39;s a bairn amongst the azaleas!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So there is!&quot; said Leslie. &quot;By Jove, a little Jap
girl come out of the wood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dom it, man,&quot; roared M&#39;Gourley, &quot;she wasn&#39;t there
twarree seconds ago. She&#39;s come out of no wood; she&#39;s
been <i>fetched</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, of all the superstitious idiots!&quot; said Leslie,
gazing from the perspiring M&#39;Gourley to the figure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
the quaint and pretty little Japanese girl who was busy
amidst the azaleas plucking the blossoms. &quot;Why,
it wouldn&#39;t take her more than &#39;twarree seconds&#39; to
come out of the wood. Anyhow, I&#39;ll go and see if she&#39;s
real.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man! man! hauld back!&quot; cried the agonized
M&#39;Gourley as his partner plunged amidst the bushes.
&quot;Ye&#39;ll be had; she&#39;s a bogle. Lord&#39;s sake! Lord&#39;s sake!
Well, gang your own gate, I&#39;m off to Nikko.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet he waited.</p>

<p class="indent">The bogle was plucking blossoms as hard as she could
and in the profuse manner of childhood. She and the
azaleas made a sight for sore eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">She might have been seven or eight, dressed in a blue
kimono with a scarlet obi, hair black as ebony shavings,
tightly drawn off the forehead and held up with a tortoiseshell
comb&mdash;the &quot;germ of a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her back was turned to Leslie, and as he got within
arm&#39;s length of the quaint and delicious little figure he
did just what you or I might have done&mdash;bent down,
seized her up, and kissed her.</p>

<p class="indent">The bogle dropped her flowers and gave a shriek, a
most distinctly human shriek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s kessed her!&quot; cried M&#39;Gourley, addressing the
azaleas, the cypress trees, and all Japan.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
Then he stood in agony, held to the spot by the sight
of Leslie and the bogle making friends.</p>

<p class="indent">It didn&#39;t seem to take long, for presently he returned
through the azaleas triumphant, carrying her in his
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s your bogle,&quot; said he, placing her on the
dusty road where, with all the gravity of the Japanese
child, she made a deep obeisance to M&#39;Gourley. That
gentleman returned the compliment with a short, sharp
nod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m awa&#39; to Nikko,&quot; said he in the hard, irritable
voice of a person who is desirous of avoiding an undesirable
acquaintance, gazing at Leslie and steadily ignoring
the lady in blue who was now holding on to
Leslie&#39;s right leg, contemplating M&#39;Gourley, and sucking
the tip of a taper and tiny forefinger all at the same
time. &quot;I&#39;m awa&#39; to Nikko. &#39;Tis no place for a mon like
me. Never was I used to the company of fules&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be an ass! Speak to her; you have the tongue,
and I haven&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I winna.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, of all the old women I ever met,&quot; said Leslie,
addressing a &quot;thundering great camellia tree&quot; that
stood opposite, &quot;this partner of mine takes the bun!&mdash;don&#39;t
he, Popsums?&quot; bending down and looking into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
small face, the left cheek of which was now resting
against his knee.</p>

<p class="indent">Popsums, in reply to the smile and interrogative tone
in the question she did not understand, smiled gravely
back and murmured something that sounded like &quot;Hei.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley snorted, and Leslie broke out laughing; he
had little of the Japanese, but he knew that &quot;Hei&quot;
meant &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h2">AMIDST THE HILLS</p>

<p class="indent">Just then a ripple of laughter came down the breeze,
and round the corner of the road, heading for
Nikko, came at full trot seven rikshas streaming out like
a scarf of color; a dream of color&mdash;for each riksha contained
a lady most beautiful to behold under the splendor
of her umbrella.</p>

<p class="indent">They were a party of girls returning to Nikko after
some sylvan freak, and they drew up as if by common
assent to admire the azaleas.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie, removing his hat and lifting his treasure trove,
held her up for exhibition.</p>

<p class="indent">The girls laughed and spoke to her; had they been
English girls she would have been promptly handed
round and kissed; and she, with becoming gravity, replied
gracefully in a few half-lisped words.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, leaving behind them on the air a cloud of dust,
a perfume of camellia oil, and a long drawn &quot;Sayonara,&quot;
the bevy of beauties passed in a gorgeous flight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
mixed colors round the bend of the road and were gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye mind he said seven rikshas were coming,&quot; cried
Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bother!&quot; answered Leslie. &quot;He&#39;d come the same direction
and passed them. Do you think they&#39;d have
laughed and spoken to her if there was anything wrong
and they&#39;re Japs, and ought to know. Come! buck up,
man! You&#39;re not afraid to do what a girl has done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A&#39;weel!&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, half ashamed of himself;
and dour as any Procurator Fiscal, he set to the examination
of the being who was now on the ground again,
her hand clasped in that of Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the result of the examination. Deponent
lived with her father. Where? She did not know.&mdash;Just
beyond there somewhere. What was the house like she
lived in? It had a plum-tree growing before it. What
did her father do? He hammered things with a hammer.
Had she any brothers and sisters? No; but&mdash;sudden
thought&mdash;she had a sugar-candy dragon, and she had
lost it. (Here deponent wept slightly and with reserve.)</p>

<p class="indent">Pause in the interrogations whilst a snub nose was
wiped with Leslie&#39;s pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">And a kite, but that was at home. She had gone that
day with a little boy&mdash;a neighbor&mdash;to hunt for the saccharine
dragon, and they had lost themselves, then they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
had lost each other, then <i>she</i> had lost herself. How was
that possible? Well, she had gone to sleep. Where? In
the wood.</p>

<p class="indent">Here the examinate went off into a tale about an impossible
tom-cat with wings, which she had once seen on
an umbrella, and beheld once again in the wood, but was
suppressed by the court and asked to keep to facts.</p>

<p class="indent">Whilst asleep in the wood she was awakened, so she
declared, by a sound like the passage of a flight of
storks, and, coming out of the wood, fearful of meeting
a dragon, she began to pick the pretty flowers; then
she was seized by the honorable gentleman, whose height
was greater than a poplar tree.</p>

<p class="indent">How old was she? Eight times the cherry blossom had
blown since her humble self had come into the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she volunteered the entirely unsolicited statement
that it was likely her little boy companion had been
lost in the snow. But that was impossible&mdash;well, it was
a field of lilies then&mdash;and he had been most possibly devoured
by a dragon.</p>

<p class="indent">What did she propose about going home? Did she
know the way, and could she go alone?</p>

<p class="indent">Here she declared herself utterly at a loss. Her home
was somewhere near by, but where, she could not exactly
say.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
&quot;Well, well!&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, when he had finished
his examination. &quot;It seems to me that bogle or no bogle
you&#39;ve saddled yoursel&#39; wi&#39; a lost child. Whaur&#39;s your
common sense now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just where it always was.&mdash;Question is&mdash;what are
we to do? Can <i>you</i> suggest anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Na, na! it&#39;s not for me to say,&quot; said the other, with
that vile sense of satisfaction a brither Scot feels when a
brither Scot has made a cubby of himself. Then, remembering
the bond of partnership, &quot;If I were the
party responsible, I&#39;d just pop her back where I fund
her first, and rin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you <i>are</i> a beast! Why, you benighted old
mummy-stuffer, I believe you&#39;ve got a scarab in your
bosom instead of a heart! I&#39;ll take her along to Nikko,
and get the police to hunt out her home. Stay, we
haven&#39;t asked her what&#39;s her name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley asked the question, and the Lost One declared
her name to be &quot;Bell-flower.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bell-flower!&quot; said Leslie, who had a smattering of
botany, &quot;that&#39;s a campanula. We&#39;ll call her&mdash;&#39;Campanula.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She also made declaration that she was quite satisfied
to go with the honorable gentleman, whose height exceeded
the tallest of trees. Leslie lifted her up and seated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
her upon his shoulder, and, as they started, he turned
and looked back at the loveliness of the perfumed azalea
valley&mdash;a sight that was yet to haunt him in the time to
come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s my opeenion,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, as they took the
road, &quot;that there was something forming in yon wood,
something dom bad, and you flung it out of the forming
eelement, and she was just suckid in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What d&#39;you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The wraith of some dead bairn was wanderin&#39; aboot,
and the forming eelement seized it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What forming element? Rubbish! That chap was a
lunatic; well, when he felt me touch him it set his lunacy
off, that&#39;s all. Why, I once went to a big asylum in
Scotland, and I saw a man cutting just the same capers,
fighting devils. He&#39;s an opium taker, and the opium is
out of his brain, that&#39;s all. Drink does the same thing&mdash;Hi!
By Jove, look up there! He&#39;s at it still.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Away up in the wild mountain gorge they saw a
figure. It was the Blind One still pursued, still running,
and apparently fighting for his life. If his actions were
not the outcome of insanity they gave food to the mind
for the most terrible suppositions.</p>

<p class="indent">Streaming with blood from his mad dashes against the
trees, he seemed surrounded on all sides, hemmed in,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
fighting furiously like a man surrounded by wolves. If
a tree chanced to be near, an opening seemed to be made
for him by his tormentors towards it, and he would rush
at it and dash himself against it, falling back bleeding
but fighting still, screaming and all the time being
steadily shepherded further and further into the loneliness
of the hills.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sirs! Sirs!&quot; cried Mac, throwing up his hands as
the horrible spectacle vanished round a distant bend of
the gorge. &quot;This is no sight for a Christian mon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s pretty rotten,&quot; said Leslie who looked rather
pale and sick. &quot;Fetch out that flask of yours, Mac.
Thanks. Poor devil! would there be any use following
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not for twanty thousand pounds would I follow
him,&quot; said Mac, gurgling at the flask. &quot;He&#39;s in ither
hands than ours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And, indeed, not for a very great sum would Leslie
have gone up that desolate gorge to see the finish of the
tragedy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s go on,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;and don&#39;t let&#39;s speak of
it again. I want to forget it&mdash;ugh!&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h2">THE TEA HOUSE OF THE TORTOISE</p>

<p class="indent">It was at the next turn that Nikko broke upon them,
a long way off, lying in its valley amidst the high
hills, hills fledged with greenery to their summit.</p>

<p class="indent">There are sights that strike the eye and the heart at
the same time, and the sight of Nikko where the Shoguns
sleep, Nikko the beautiful in the silent valley, amidst
the silent hills, is one of these.</p>

<p class="indent">The delicate colors, the exquisite tracery of the temple
roofs, the crystal clearness of the air through which
the eye can pick out detail after detail, the atmosphere
of tranquillity of the mountains, and the green cryptomeria
trees, make up a picture, leaving little
for the heart to desire, or the imagination to conceive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; cried Leslie, turning to his companion (Campanula
was seated aloft in solitary state upon his shoulder
clutching his hair tight, whilst he held in one big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
hand her two little sandal-shod, tabi-clad feet), &quot;if
that&#39;s Nikko, it&#39;s ten miles off if it&#39;s a foot. What&#39;ve
you got to say for yourself, hey?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A&#39;weel,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, glowering at Nikko, &quot;if
you want my candid opeenion, we&#39;ve juist gone astray;
the country I know well, but these dom roads lead one
like a Jack o&#39;Lanthorn. It&#39;s my opeenion that a Japanese
road&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want your opinion on Japanese roads, I
want your concise opinion about yourself&mdash;ain&#39;t you
a fool?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, as if considering the matter,
&quot;a fule I may be, but it&#39;s my candit opeenion that
I&#39;m not the only fule in Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;fool or no fool, we&#39;ll have to
tramp it, and you&#39;ll have to take your turn to carry the
kid, so&mdash;<i>Marchons</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula, so far from being frightened at her awful
elevation from the earth, seemed to enjoy the situation,
and to find food for a sort of muse of her own, for
she began to hum as Leslie took the road with his long
stride, and to sing in a lisping sort of way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s she singing?&quot; demanded her bearer of the
sweating Scot at his side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord knows! &#39;tis an eldritch chune, and I dinna like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
to listen to the words. Man, Leslie, but your legs are
longer than mine, and I canna keep the pace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll go slower if you&#39;ll listen, and tell me what
she&#39;s singing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s singing,&quot; gasped M&#39;Gourley, &quot;s&#39; far as I can
make out, some diddering noensense aboot a sugar-candy
dragon that a man like a poplar tree is goin&#39; to hunt, he
and a man like a corbie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More like some bogle from the wood that&#39;s maybe
after us now. I am not a supersteetious man&mdash;na, na!
ye may laugh or not&mdash;but would y&#39; like to know what in
my humble opeenion you are cartin&#39; on your shoulders?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some bairn that has been lost and dead these years,
and has been whustled up by that blind deevil with the
pipe. What did she mean by that reeference to the snaw&mdash;answer
me that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I can get into the mind of a Japanese child,
and see the world as it sees it, I&#39;ll answer you; you know
what children&#39;s minds are, how they mix and imagine
things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did she mean by that reeference to the snaw?&quot;
grimly went on M&#39;Gourley. &quot;Mix or no mix, what did
she mean by the other bairn being lost in the snaw?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;I don&#39;t care a button whether
she&#39;s a bogle or not. If she is, she&#39;s the prettiest bogle
that was ever bogled, and about the heaviest, I should
think. Here, you take a turn with her, I&#39;m about done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They took it turn about, M&#39;Gourley vastly loth, to
carry the Lost One; and the Lost One stopped them to
gather flowers for her by the wayside, to give her drinks
from rivulets, to help her admire and wonder at herons
and other marvels of the way, so that it was after six of
the clock when two of the most dusty and perspiring
Scotchmen in the Eastern Hemisphere entered the happy
village of Nikko from the mountain side, Campanula
this time on Leslie&#39;s shoulder, grave, triumphant, and
holding a huge lily in her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Nikko and its surroundings just now was ablaze with
scarlet japonica. The lamps of the camellias were lit,
the soaring wistaria vines had broken into clusters of
pale lilac blossoms, the iris beautified the field, and the
wild cherry the thicket. It was as if spring had called
from the tomb of Iyeyasu and her faithful had come to
pray.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two hotels at Nikko known to the globe-trotter,
&quot;Kanayas&quot; and the &quot;New Nikko,&quot; but M&#39;Gourley
knew a better place than these.</p>

<p class="indent">As they passed down the long inclined street a baby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
with a shaved head, a baby that was half a baby and
half an obi, tied behind in a stiff and preposterous bow,
spied Campanula being borne aloft, dropped his immediate
business&mdash;the attempt to fly a kite shaped like a
moth&mdash;and followed the newcomers with a shout.</p>

<p class="indent">The shout, as if by magic, brought half a dozen children
from nowhere in particular; girl children with dolls
on their backs, older girl children with babies on their
backs, boys battledore in hand, and all with clogs on
their feet, clogs that went clipper-clapper, waking up
the echoes and calling forth more children, so that when
they had got half-way down the mile-long street from
the upper village Campanula had a &quot;following,&quot; the
like of which had never been seen, perhaps, since the pied
piper passed through Hamelin.</p>

<p class="indent">A colored, laughing, murmuring, rippling throng
following with every eye fixed on the Lost One borne sky-high
on the shoulder of the tall stranger; a throng, the
half of which could have walked under a dinner-table
without much inconvenience; some empty-handed, some
still grasping their implements of play, all agog, yet
of decent and orderly behavior. A throng, in fact, of
ladies and gentlemen in the making.</p>

<p class="indent">Backward over the summit of Leslie gazed Campanula
upon this crowd, whilst the stall-keepers and the stray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
riksha men, the pilgrims and the paupers, the priest and
the policeman, stood by the way to watch the procession
pass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; called Leslie to his companion, who was limping
behind dead beat, yet in an agony at the &quot;splurge&quot;
they were making, &quot;this is gay, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dod rot the child!&quot; cried M&#39;Gourley, nearly tumbling
over a fat baby with a tufted head, who was running
in front of him and trying to look up in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dinna ken whoat ye mean by gay. I have no immeediate
particular use for the waurd. Never before have
I been held up to public reedicule. I&#39;m a decent livin&#39;
man, ye ken, an&#39; I ha&#39;na any use for such gayeties. I
leave them to ithers who care for makin&#39; assinine eediots
of theirselves; but, thank the Laird, we&#39;re nearly there
noo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They turned a corner and entered a gate that led to
a garden.</p>

<p class="indent">At the gate M&#39;Gourley turned and addressed the camp
followers, telling them with forced politeness that there
was nothing more to be seen; that the show was over,
in fact, and asking them honorably to excuse him the
pleasure of being followed any more.</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd murmured, and dissolved, the earth seemed
to take it up like blotting-paper, and M&#39;Gourley, turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
his back upon its remnants, led the way through the
garden, past a tiny lake in the midst of which stood an
island, inhabited by a huge frog, and so, by a path, to
the front of a long, low, white-washed house.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the Tea House of the Tortoise, a place well
known to M&#39;Gourley, as (to use his own abominable expression)
being &quot;cheap and clean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A panel of the front was drawn back, revealing cream-white
matting and lamp light.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley sat down with a sigh on the side of the
veranda, and began to pull off his elastic side boots.
Leslie sat down also, with Campanula in his lap; he
could not put her down for she had literally tumbled
into sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pull off my boots, Mac,&quot; said he. &quot;I can&#39;t let go of
this blessed child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Na!&quot; said Mac mysteriously, and somewhat viciously,
as he knelt down and unlaced his partner&#39;s boots,
&quot;ye cannot let her go, ye cannot let her go; forby, she
wullna let <i>you</i> go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think she&#39;s going to stick to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Imphim,&quot; replied Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">Imphim is not Japanese, it is the double Scotch grunt,
which has twenty-two separate meanings, mostly unpleasant.
Shut your mouth tight and try to say &quot;Hum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
hum,&quot; and you will achieve &quot;Imphim,&quot; but never do it
again, please.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie was about to answer, when a sound behind made
him turn, and there, like a pinned-down butterfly, was a
Mousm&egrave; on the mat, crying, &quot;Irashi, condescend to enter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley&mdash;a most unengaging figure in his stocking
feet&mdash;rose and addressed the Mousm&egrave;.</p>

<p class="indent">He told her things in language unknown to Leslie;
things about the sleeping Campanula evidently, for he
pump-handled with his arm in the direction where Leslie,
bootless now, sat holding her.</p>

<p class="indent">The Mousm&egrave; on her knees, a camellia blossom in her
hair and her eyes fixed upon M&#39;Gourley, seemed fascinated.
Then she called out and....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai tadaima,&quot; came a soft voice from somewhere in
the back premises, and a second Mousm&egrave; appeared, made
obeisance, and listened whilst the tale, whatever it was,
was laid before her.</p>

<p class="indent">Deep astonishment, exclamations of wonder, a call:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hai tadaima!&quot; and an old lady appeared, and
made obeisance, and listened whilst the thrice-told tale
was told her by the two Mousm&egrave;s and M&#39;Gourley all
together.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Leslie, feeling ridiculously like a nursemaid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
sat holding the Lost One, whose soul was wandering
in the vain land of dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you stuffing those creatures up with?&quot;
he suddenly broke out. &quot;Blessed if you oughtn&#39;t to be
dressed in a kimono and a petticoat; you&#39;re the biggest
old woman of the lot. Ask one of them to take the kid,
or I&#39;ll go off to the hotel with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One minit,&quot; said Mac. &quot;They&#39;re conseedrin&#39; the
matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Scarce had he spoken when the old lady called out,
and entered on the scene, an old gentleman, the proprietor
of the tea house, a black cat, and two more
Mousm&egrave;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, <i>do</i> call a few more!&quot; said Leslie. &quot;And call in
a couple of musicians and make the comic opera complete.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are no more to call,&quot; replied Mac. &quot;They are
conseedrin&#39; the matter. The Japanese are a very supersteetious
people, and these are good friends of mine, and
I would not spring a pairson upon them with dootful
anticeedents. You see, Leslie, man, the presence of the
bairn must be explained. She is not a bale of goods we
can dump in a corner. Bide a wee; I will talk them over
yut.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Areopagus was considering the question as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
whether Campanula, if admitted to the Tea House of
the Tortoise, would bring ruin and destruction or a blessing
on the premises, when Hedgehog San, the black cat,
settled the matter by coming up to Leslie and rubbing
against his leg.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the Hon. Hedgehog&mdash;may his ashes rest in
peace!&mdash;jumped on Leslie&#39;s knee and rubbed himself
against Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">That clinched the business.</p>

<p class="indent">The old lady herself advanced, and, taking the Lost
One from the Weary One, carried her bodily into the
house, whilst Leslie, yawning and stretching himself,
followed.</p>

<p class="indent">Inside, in the bare, clean room, the little Mousm&egrave; with
the camellia in her hair addressed herself to Leslie in a
soft and beseeching voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does she want?&quot; he asked of Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She wants to know if you require anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A bath&mdash;that&#39;s what I want more than anything&mdash;don&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not given to promeescuous bathing,&quot; said
M&#39;Gourley, &quot;being greatly subject to the siatickee; but
a bath you wull have, and I&#39;ll e&#39;en sit here and smoke a
pipe whilst you bathe yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want also a sugar-candy dragon for the bairn,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
said Leslie. &quot;Ask &#39;em to send out and get one. I suppose
you can get such things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley gave the message to the maid, and she departed.</p>

<p class="indent">The travelers&#39; luggage&mdash;a frightful-looking old mid-Victorian
carpet bag belonging to M&#39;Gourley, and a
Gladstone of Leslie&#39;s&mdash;had already arrived at the tea
house, having been sent on by rail <i>via</i> Utsu-no-Miya,
and the two sat down on small square cushions, placed
on the cream-colored matting, to smoke a pipe, whilst
dinner and the bath were preparing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The police will be here the morn about that bairn,&quot;
said Mac in his cheerful way, &quot;and we&#39;ll have to acoont
for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course we will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; said Mac, &quot;but have you ever acoonted for
a thing to the Japanese police?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, considering I&#39;ve only been in Japan ten days,
I haven&#39;t had much time, you see, to fall foul of the
police.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I found a scairf pin once,&quot; said this comforter of
Job, &quot;on the Bund at Nagasaki. Twa-and-sax-pence it
was worth, or maybe three shullin&#39;, and I took it to the
police office and began to acoont for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped and sighed and sucked his pipe.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m acoontin&#39; for it still, and that&#39;s three
months ago; letters and papers, and papers and letters
enough to drive a man daft! Well, I&#39;m thinkin&#39; if a
twa-and-saxpenny scairf pin can cause such a wully
waugh, what&#39;s a live bairn going to do? Now, I&#39;m
thinking&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I give you a piece of advice, Mac?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am always open to judeecious advice,&quot; answered
the unsuspecting Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don&#39;t think too much or you&#39;ll hurt yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley grunted, and at that moment the Mousm&egrave;
with the camellia in her hair entered with the announcement
that the bath was ready in the room above, and
Leslie departed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you have shown the honorable gentleman the
bath, come down; I wish to speak to you,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley
to the lady of the camellia. She obeyed the request
and M&#39;Gourley held her in light conversation, till he
knew by the sounds above that his partner was in the
tub. Then he released the handmaiden, and she departed
upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">He listened, and presently he heard Leslie&#39;s voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go away, please. Good heavens I say, I <i>wish</i> you&#39;d
go away! No, I don&#39;t want soap. I say, Mac! Hi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
McGourley!&mdash;leave my back alone&mdash;<i>M&#39;Gourley</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But M&#39;Gourley, like an Indian Sachem, smoked on
and answered not.</p>

<p class="indent">He was having his revenge for the Nikko road.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="h2">THE DREAMER AND THE DRAGON</p>

<p class="indent">They had finished dinner; a dinner which began
with tea and bean flour cakes, passed on to fish
served on little mats of grass, went on to soup served
in lacquered bowls, proceeded to prawns; halted, hesitated,
and went back to soup, scratched its head, so to
speak, and then, as if with an after-thought, served up a
quail, apologized for the substantiality of the quail by
presenting a salted plum on a little plate, and then
harked shamelessly back to soup, ending deliriously with
a shower of little dishes containing everything inconceivable,
and a big bowl of rice.</p>

<p class="indent">This is an impressionist picture of a Japanese dinner.
I have eaten many, but I have never carried away
more than an impression, and whether kuchi-tori comes
before hachiz-a-kana, I cannot say, or where the seaweed
or salted fish come in&mdash;but come in they do, they
and other things stranger than themselves.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
A <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> was thrumming somewhere in the house
as they dined, sitting on the soft white matting, and
waited upon by two Mousm&egrave;s crouched on the matting
like little panthers preparing to spring.</p>

<p class="indent">A slid back panel of the front wall made a doorway
through which they could see the moon wandering over
Nikko, casting her cool white light upon the blazing
japonica flowers, the glory of the camellias, the roofs of
the temples, and the sad dark beauty of the cryptomeria
trees.</p>

<p class="indent">Nikko by day is fair, but by night, when the moon is
overhead, when the air is full of the sounds of wandering
waters, and the wind is heavy with the perfume of
the wild azaleas, Nikko is a dream.</p>

<p class="indent">When the tea and bean cakes had been served, the
moon was in the act of washing weakly a house gable
across the garden, and a pale lilac-colored flower of the
wistaria, which projected above the extemporized doorway;
but by the time the quail had made its appearance,
the garden was solid in moonlight, the pond was a mirror,
and the frog self-marooned on the little island, was
as distinct as if seen by daylight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must learn Japanese,&quot; said Leslie, taking a cigarette-case
from his pocket and lighting a cigarette at
the tobacco-mono that stood at his elbow. &quot;My lines are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
cast in Japan, that&#39;s clear, but a man without the language
is a helpless baby.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley. &quot;You can easily get
instruction in the Japanese: take a wumman to live
with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t looked at a woman for ten years, and I
don&#39;t want to look at one again.&quot; Then suddenly bursting out:
&quot;Why, you old scamp, talking like that&mdash;you
told me you were a member of the Free Kirk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Wee Kirk,&quot; corrected Mac, leisurely lighting
his pipe with an ember from the hibachi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Free Kirk or Wee Kirk, you ought to be jolly
well ashamed of yourself; and were you a member of the
Wee Kirk when you were constructing idols in Birmingham
with old What&#39;s-his-name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Na, na; those were my godless days. I got my
releegion late in life, and a vara good releegion it is; a
waurkable releegion, one that does not heat in the bearings,
but runs smooth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is this wonderful religion, if I may ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is noet so much wonderful as waurkable, and it
may be compreezed in the sentence: &#39;Do unto ithers as
ithers would do unto you.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O good Lord! and you call that a religion! Why,
you precious old humbug, that means you can rob, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
plunder, and murder, and cheat&mdash;that is to say, you can
act like a beast towards people who would act so to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there&#39;s one thing I like about you, you&#39;re
frank, to say the least of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This remark seemed greatly to incense Mac, who, perhaps,
misunderstood the meaning of the word frank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When y&#39;ve been in the waurld as long as I have,
surrounded on ivry side by scoondrels and robbers, y&#39;ll
maybee be as fraunk as mysel&#39;. Fraunk.&mdash;wid ye give me
a defineetion of the waurd&mdash;fraunk! I wid have ye to
understand I&#39;m an hoenest mon with hoenest men, but
<i>I&#39;m a scoondrel wi&#39; scoondrels</i>. Fraunk!&quot; And so he
went on, his Scotch accent deepening as deepened his
excitement, till at last he broke down into Gaelic, and
thundered his remarks at the hibachi, slapping his thigh
as he did so, and wakening the echoes of the house, which
was resonant as a fiddle. So that by the time he had got
to the end of his exordium, Leslie saw a panel waver back
an inch, and the lady of the camellia peeping in to see
what the Learned One was shouting about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep your hair on,&quot; said Leslie, when Mac, with a
final &quot;Fraunk!&quot; delivered in English, began to refill
and light his pipe. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to insult you; I
only meant to say I like your open-heartedness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
&quot;Ay, I was ever that to those I had a liking for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I meant more precisely your open-mindedness&mdash;but
no matter, let&#39;s talk of something else. I wonder where
they&#39;ve put the kid, and oh, by Jove! I wonder if
they&#39;ve got that dragon. Sing out and ask, like a good
chap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac clapped his hands, and &quot;Hai tadaima!&quot; came as
a response.</p>

<p class="indent">It was worth the trouble of clapping one&#39;s hands to
hear that sweet reply.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later, a panel slid back and the camellia
lady appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula San was asleep, and at that very moment
Wild-cherry-bud was in search of the Hon. Dragon,
with orders to leave no confectioner&#39;s stall unvisited till
she had secured him.</p>

<p class="indent">This with immovable gravity and deep, sweet earnestness
of tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Leslie when she had withdrawn, &quot;of all
the people I have struck yet, give me the Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait till you&#39;ve had beesiness transactions with
them,&quot; said Mac darkly. &quot;I am no so unfreenly to the
Japs in or&#39;nary life, but in beesiness the Jap&#39;s a wrugglin&#39;
sairpent&mdash;all but one&mdash;Danjuro&mdash;the man we&#39;re
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
going to join in partnership; he&#39;s as straight as a
Chinee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He must be damn crooked then!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cruik&#39;d enough to make his way in Japan, but
straight enough to a freend; but you&#39;re a poet, man,
Leslie, and no beesiness man. I kent y&#39; for a poet when
you sang that bit song on the road&mdash;the song aboot the
camellia trees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That rubbish! It&#39;s not mine; I read it in the Sydney
<i>Bulletin</i>. Funny enough, too, it was the first thing
that made me think of coming to Japan! Poetry! Good
God! Put a man through the remittance mill in Sydney
and see all the poetry that will be left in him! Put a
butterfly through a sausage machine and then see how
beautifully it will fly! Yes, I was once a poet; years
and years ago I was a poet&mdash;a poet who never wrote anything,
but a poet for all that. I could see the beauty of
the world; and then they blinded me. Who? I don&#39;t
know&mdash;the world. Maybe it was myself, maybe not.
Maybe it was my father, maybe not. I only state the
fact that something in me is dead&mdash;the something that
took joy in life and found beauty in innocence&mdash;or was
dead till I came to Japan. Oh, M&#39;Gourley, man, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
years I&#39;ve spent in Sydney under a cloud, mixing with
bar loafers, cursing my father and myself; the years
I&#39;ve spent in Sydney have broken my soul in me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did ye not waurk?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Work! I had just enough money to keep me from
starvation and decently dressed. I might have got a
clerkship; for what good? To make another hundred a
year. To spend on what? Can you not understand, man,
that my mainspring was gone, that I was put out of
the world I knew, tied by the leg to Sydney, bound to
appear every quarter-day at the double-damned lawyer&#39;s
office, or starve? Two things only kept me alive&mdash;tobacco
and books&mdash;saved me from myself and from
drink.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What sort of a mon was your faither?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A hard, dour, just man&mdash;a man who could make no
allowance for folly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, ay! Had y&#39; any brithers and sisters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never a one, and my mother died when I was two;
and he used to leather me. Well, you can fancy my joy
when old Bloomfield, the lawyer, sent for me one day
and said: &#39;I&#39;ve bad news for you, Mr. Leslie.&#39; &#39;What&#39;s
that?&#39; said I. &#39;Your father is dead. He died intestate,
and you have inherited his property. I am advised it
amounts to over twenty-one thousand pounds.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&quot;Twenty-one thousand?&quot; said Mac in admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; and I said to Bloomfield: &#39;You must be either
a fool or a hypocrite, for that&#39;s the best news I ever
heard in my life, and you know it.&#39; Then some instinct
took me over here to Japan. I was thinking of going to
England, but I found all at once I had a horror of England
and the English, so I came to Japan; and glad I
am I came. Can you fancy what these people here are
to me after the population of Sydney&mdash;those raucous,
horse-racing, drink-swilling beasts? Then I fell in with
you at Tokyo, and took a fancy to your old Scotch
mug&mdash;and here we are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment a little figure crossed the garden,
bearing a lantern on the end of a stick. It was Wild-cherry-bud;
and presently she appeared with the much-sought-for
dragon wrapped in rice paper.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a wonderful creation with a twisted tail, rather
stumpy wings, but with a mouth that made up for all
defects; nothing so ferocious had ever perhaps before
been done in sugar candy.</p>

<p class="indent">When the thing had been inspected and approved,
Wild-cherry-bud led the way to where Campanula slept,
for Leslie wished his present to be placed beside her, so
that she might find it when she awoke.</p>

<p class="indent">The Lost One, looking very much lost indeed on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
huge futon (a quilt thicker than a muffin), and covered
by a blue mosquito-net with red bound edges, was so
profoundly asleep that the clicking of the net being
pulled aside and the light of the night lantern borne by
Wild-cherry-bud did not disturb her. She was sleeping
on her back, the top futon only drawn to her waist, and
her little perfectly shaped white hands were crossed
pathetically on her breast.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie knelt down, and lifting one little hand placed
the long-sought monster beneath it. The hand clasped
the dragon, the long-sought dragon, and across the
sleeper&#39;s face passed what seemed the ghost of a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A&#39;weel!&quot; thought Mac as he looked on, &quot;had he a
bairn he&#39;d make a better faither to it than his own
faither made to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the mosquito-net was drawn and they departed,
leaving Campanula to the possession of her dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">Up in their room Leslie steadily refused to undress
till the waiting Mousm&egrave; had &quot;cleared out.&quot; He had
already refused to allow her to rub his back when he
was in his tub and now this&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">The Tea House of the Tortoise people, good old-fashioned,
Japanese inn people, unused to foreign follies,
could not make it out.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
The Areopagus convened itself again, and held
council by the light of an andon, or night lantern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What could it mean?&quot; There was simply no meaning
in it. Such a thing had never happened before, and
the general conclusion was that Leslie had &quot;gone gyte.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the Areopagus went to bed all together under
the same mosquito-net, and silence reigned with the
moon over the Tea House of the Tortoise. The moon
wandering over Nikko touching temple and tea-house
pointed a pallid finger between the window chinks of the
room where the Lost One lay asleep, as if to show her
to the night. Clasping the candy dragon whose ferocious
eyes shone carbuncle-like in the placid moonlight she
made a strange picture, veiled by the blue gauze of the
mosquito-net.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h2">HOW CAMPANULA BROUGHT FORTUNE TO THE HOUSE OF THE TORTOISE&mdash;AND OTHER THINGS</p>

<p class="indent">The sun rose up and struck Nikko; struck the
sacred red lacquered bridge that crosses the foaming
river, and the common bridge that you and I may
use, the potter&#39;s shop, and the golden shrine of Iyeyasu.</p>

<p class="indent">Then temple after temple broke up from shadow as
the sun reached for them and found them, and the hills
took on a momentary splendor, an ethereal loveliness,
evanescent as youth and never to be recaptured by the
day.</p>

<p class="indent">In the garden of the Tea House of the Tortoise a
bomb-shell full of bickering sparrows seemed suddenly
to burst above the pond, the sun looked over the wall
upon the dwarf maples in their blue porcelain flowerpots,
a panel of the white house front slid back and a
Mousm&egrave; appeared, her head tied up in a blue cotton
duster; appeared another Mousm&egrave;, dragging a futon to
air in the morning brightness, and yet another who came
out and yawned at the sun, showing him the full extent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
of her pink gullet, and every one of her thirty-two white
teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Hedgehog San, a cat honored and beloved,
came forth with tail erect, and a grasshopper hanging
by the veranda in a tiny cage creaked forth a thin
hymn of praise.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus started the day at the Tea House of the Tortoise.</p>

<p class="indent">When Leslie and M&#39;Gourley came downstairs&mdash;a stair
like a ship&#39;s companion-way but without any balustrade&mdash;they
found Campanula having her obi tied by
Fir-branch (she who had yawned at the sun), and Leslie
was informed through his partner that the dragon had
been found and that he had grown; this statement, with
some confidential information concerning a thunder-cat
of which she had dreamed, Mac translated from the
original with a serious face.</p>

<p class="indent">Up to this he had treated the Lost One as an adult,
and as a most undesirable adult, with whom he wished
to have nothing to do. But Campanula, fresh and
spruce in the light of morning, chattering over her
shoulder to you about thunder-cats, whilst Fir-branch
tied her obi in a huge bow, was a person whose charm
was not to be denied, and Mac began to thaw.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s a thunder-cat?&quot; asked Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
&quot;Lord only knows! some contraption in the shape of
an animal that makes thunder. The Japs are full of
supersteetions about animals. Wull we out before breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie the night before had declared his intention of
sending for the police next morning before the police
sent for him, and had given a message to the landlord
accordingly. But he might have saved his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">Nikko was agog. Whether the tale had leaked
through the chinks of the Tea House of the Tortoise,
whether Wild-cherry-bud had distributed it during her
peregrinations in search of the dragon, no one will ever
know; the fact remains that the story of Campanula had
gone abroad with additions&mdash;all sorts of weird and
wonderful additions. Half Nikko had seen her borne
aloft on the shoulders of Leslie, the other half had heard
extraordinary statements concerning her origin; the
result was that the whole of Nikko ached inwardly with
a great ache of curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">By seven o&#39;clock fifteen Mousm&egrave;s or maybe twenty,
had arrived singly and in couples, not to ask questions,
but to borrow things, or to offer the loan of things, or to
ask after the health of old mother Ranunculus, the
landlady of the &quot;Tortoise.&quot; Incidentally they learned
about Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
A juggler had made her on the Nikko road. Out of
what, for goodness&#39; sake? Out of a wild azalea bush!</p>

<p class="indent">No!</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, assuredly, the Learned One had said so.</p>

<p class="indent">And what had become of the juggler? He had vanished
in a clap of thunder&mdash;turned into a dragon.</p>

<p class="indent">Surprising!</p>

<p class="indent">And they went off to spread the news.</p>

<p class="indent">At half-past eight, or thereabouts, a little man in
white, the chief of the Nikko police, arrived. He had
come officially, but he also was aching to get to the truth
of this marvelous tale.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the Japanese police is the most perfect police
force in the world in every respect. They are recruited
from the Samurai or fighting-class, and they are gentlemen
to a man.</p>

<p class="indent">The chief of the Nikko police made profound apologies
for disturbing the peace of the strangers, then he
heard the story told by M&#39;Gourley.</p>

<p class="indent">He agreed that it was strange, but opined that the
Lost One might simply be a lost child. Where exactly
was she found? In a valley of crimson azaleas on the
road from Kureise. Ah, yes! there was such a valley
well known, for the azaleas were crimson, and differed
from the wild scarlet azaleas so common hereabouts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
There were also villages around there, and tea houses; it
might possibly be that she belonged to one of these.
As to the mad man they had seen running away, no
one else had seen him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Campanula was brought in and questioned, the
whole of the &quot;Tortoise&quot; people squatting round in a
ring, even down to Hedgehog San, who sat with judicial
gravity, and seemed to be taking mental notes.</p>

<p class="indent">She told her little tale about the house with the plum
tree in front of it, and the kite, and the sugar-candy
dragon which she had lost and found again. How
the said dragon had grown very much, and seemed different,
but tasted all right. Here she hastened to explain
that she had not eaten him, only touched him
with her tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">She could not possibly say what men called her father.
He hammered things. What sort of things? She did not
know, but they went pong, pong, pong, when he struck
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tinsmith,&quot; murmured M&#39;Gourley.</p>

<p class="indent">She was sure of one thing, that her father&#39;s house was
quite close to the wood and the azalea valley.</p>

<p class="indent">How old was she?</p>

<p class="indent">Seven times had the cherry blossoms blown since her
humble self&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
&quot;Hauld there,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley. Then in Japanese
he explained that yesterday she had declared that eight
times the cherry blossoms had blown since her humble
self, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, yes! but how was she to know? a lump of mud
like her!</p>

<p class="indent">In conclusion, she took back her statement about the
snow. She must have dreamt that in the wood.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the court began to consult, the &quot;lump of mud&quot;
sitting in their midst pensive and rather sad, a scarlet
flower in her black hair, and the bow of her obi looking
very stiff and huge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; said Leslie at last. &quot;Tell him I&#39;ll look
after her, and pay all expenses till she&#39;s found. Tell
him to have the place searched, all that wood and
country, and I&#39;ll pay for it; and if they can&#39;t find her
people I&#39;ll adopt her. I will, begad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac translated.</p>

<p class="indent">At first the chief of police seemed to think that the
&quot;lump of mud&quot; should be hauled off to the police
office&mdash;impounded, in short; then M&#39;Gourley intervened.
M&#39;Gourley was a power in Japan just then, for the
astute Scot had made himself very useful to the government
in past years, and the chief of police, when he
heard what Mac had to say, agreed to leave matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
where they were whilst the country was being searched,
and the chief of police at Tokyo communicated with.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he took his departure, and here began the prosperity
of the Tea House of the Tortoise.</p>

<p class="indent">Three elderly gentlemen in kimonos were the first to
arrive; after them a youth in a bowler hat, and with the
face of an uninspired idiot. These sat round and sipped
saki and smoked little pipes, and talked to Wild-cherry-bud
and Fir-branch, and listened to the grasshopper
singing in his cage, whilst more guests arrived, and still
more. So that Fir-branch, Wild-cherry-bud, &amp; Co., were
full of business, so full indeed that mother Ranunculus,
driven to her wits&#39; end, sent out for hired help.</p>

<p class="indent">At eleven, when M&#39;Gourley and his companion went
out to inspect the golden Shrines, the Tea House of the
Tortoise was humming like a bee-hive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a funny business,&quot; said Leslie, as they turned
the corner into the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m thinkin&#39;,&quot; said Mac, &quot;that you&#39;ll no find it so
funny a beesiness in the end.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE SURPRISING STORY OF MOMOTARO&mdash;AKUDOGI AND SPOTTED DOG</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care a button,&quot; said Leslie, on the third
morning of their stay in Nikko. &quot;Danjuro may
go be hanged. I&#39;m not going to leave here till I&#39;ve
settled about the kid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, ay!&quot; said Mac. &quot;The man who will to Cupar
maun to Cupar. I would only imprees upon you this,
that time is going and time is money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know; but it won&#39;t take more than a few days
now. They say they&#39;ve hunted the whole country round
there, and can&#39;t find trace of her people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Na, and never will. If she has onny real people
they won&#39;t fash themselves aboot her; girls in Japan
are as plentiful as blaeberries in Lorne&mdash;you&#39;re sadlit
with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I want her, that&#39;s the truth. I&#39;ve taken a
fancy to her; she&#39;s not the sort of thing one picks every
day&mdash;she and her thunder-cats and dragons.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
&quot;I won&#39;t say she is not an attractif wee boddie,&quot; said
Mac, &quot;but think of the future, mon, when she&#39;s graun
up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bother the future! I&#39;m rich enough to see after
her. D&#39;y know, Mac&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder did she come out of those azaleas?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac gave a grunt.</p>

<p class="indent">Curiously enough, his point of view had changed, and
he was now convinced, or pretended to be convinced,
that the treasure trove was a solid body and no bogle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because,&quot; went on Leslie, &quot;it may be fact or fancy,
but when I picked her up she seemed slipping away into
thin air till I kissed her, and then she became solid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Imphim,&quot; said Mac, using a variation of the sound
that was simply stuffed with meanings all uncomplimentary
to Leslie&#39;s intelligence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They used to tell me when I was a kid that babies
came out of parsley beds. Well, I&#39;m half inclined to
believe the tale has come true at last, and she came out of
those azalea bushes. Of course,&quot; said Leslie suddenly,
and as if apologizing to his own common sense, &quot;I
don&#39;t really believe it, but I like to fancy it; it&#39;s so much
nicer than thinking she came into the world the other
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
The prosperity of the Tea House of the Tortoise still
continued, people coming from far and near to get a
glimpse of the foundling.</p>

<p class="indent">Every day Mac and Leslie would take her out for a
walk, and she clopped beside them in her little clogs
delightfully grave, and seemingly unmindful of the
polite following of children that always tailed after
them without appearing quite to do so. Children bouncing
colored balls, playing hop scotch or what not, yet
always with an eye on the child that had come out of
the azaleas.</p>

<p class="indent">Shopping with Campanula Leslie found to be a new
pleasure; a present, no matter what, was received with
such deep thankfulness, such quaint expressions of
gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent">He ordered Mother Ranunculus&mdash;requested her,
rather&mdash;to get a complete new outfit for his charge,
everything that money could buy, from tabi to hairpins,
from kimonos to clogs. As for toys, she simply wallowed
in them: bouncing balls and battledores fell round her
as if from the sky, not to mention a doll as big as a baby
of three, which she instantly became a mother to, carting
it about on her back tucked under her kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">The one thing that disturbed Leslie was her seeming
indifference to her own strange position. Beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
bald statement that she had a father, she never referred
to that enigmatical gentleman, nor did she grieve, outwardly
at least, about her separation from him.</p>

<p class="indent">By the end of the week the two Scotchmen and their
charge began to be welded into a corporate body&mdash;a
little quaint family party. It was strange the influence
of this child upon these two men whom fate had drawn
together from the corners of the earth. Leslie, with
newly acquired interest in life, had grown five years
younger in mind, and as for Mac, he had grown ten
degrees more human. His withered fatherly instincts
were awakened&mdash;at least they opened one eye&mdash;and it
was pretty to see him with his gnarled, horny hands
and intent, weather-beaten face making chickens for the
Lost One out of orange pips.</p>

<p class="indent">They would go out, all three, and wander about
Nikko and its temples, and they would sit on grassy
banks in the gardens of Dai Nichi Do, just as a father
and an uncle and niece might sit on seats in Kensington
Gardens, and then Leslie and his partner would discuss
the future and trade, whilst Campanula played with her
doll or bounced a ball.</p>

<p class="indent">Here one day, whilst the sun shone on the little lake
and the pink and copper maples, the tiny islands and
bridges and pagodas, Campanula, weary of play, told,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
in a sing-song voice and broken manner, the story of
Momotaro, otherwise called Peachboy, and his wonderful
deeds. She told it standing before them, and striking
attitudes suitable to the phases of the tale.</p>

<p class="indent">One day, it appears, an old woman found a huge
peach, and she was just going to cut it in two with a
knife when the peach broke open, and out tumbled a
baby. This very surprising thing happened a long time
ago, but exactly when Campanula could not possibly
say.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Peachboy grew up, and every day he grew
fatter and stronger, till at last he grew so big that he
determined to fight Akudogi, the king of the Ogres,
who lived on an island&mdash;somewhere. And he started out,
said Campanula, with a sword and a bag full of millet
dumplings, each with a salted plum in the center, to
fight the Ogres.</p>

<p class="indent">Here she took from her sleeve a paper of sweets, and
gravely presented it to her companions, who each took
one. She took one herself, consumed it, and resumed the
narrative.</p>

<p class="indent">On the way he met a spotted dog, a monkey, and a
crow, and to each he gave a dumpling, and they followed
him to the attack on Akudogi, the king of the
Ogres.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
The narrator&#39;s voice became deeper in tone, and she
spread out her fingers as if in fear.</p>

<p class="indent">The crow flew first to the castle of Akudogi and held
him in talk, whilst Peachboy, spotted dog, and the
monkey, got over the castle wall.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula was now standing before her auditors in a
most dramatic attitude, her hands uplifted, the fallen
back sleeves of her kimono showing her arms, and her
brown eyes full of fear. She did not seem to see either
Leslie or M&#39;Gourley. Her eyes were fixed on the frightful
Akudogi, and Peachboy, the spotted dog and the
monkey, who were about to attack him.</p>

<p class="indent">The crow, when he saw that his companions had
gained an entrance to the castle, flew away with a laugh,
and Akudogi turned and beheld Peachboy and his brave
companions. He gnashed his teeth, pulled out his
sword, and oh!</p>

<p class="indent">Frightened to death with her own imaginations, she
rushed with a little shriek into Mac&#39;s arms for protection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hauld yourself taegether; I winna let them catch
ye! I winna let them catch ye!&quot; cried Mac, as he
clasped the perfumed bundle that had flung itself into
his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s all that she was telling?&quot; asked Leslie, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
felt rather jealous that Mac should have been chosen
as the harbor of refuge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only a daft tale about ogres an&#39; spotted dogs.
She&#39;s clean crackit on all sorts of queer beasties. Only
last night she told me a tale aboot a rat that played
the fiddle an&#39; a tortoise that came to listen, and she told
what the tortoise speired an&#39; what the rat made answer,
till you could have sworn you heard the rat and the
tortoise claverin&#39; taegither.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, hand her over here,&quot; said Leslie; &quot;she&#39;s not
yours.&quot; And he took Campanula from Mac and placed
her on his knee. &quot;She&#39;s mine. I paid ten shillings to
that chap with the reed-pipe to whistle her up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what,&quot; said Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll gi&#39; you ten shullin&#39; for a half share, and pay
half the expeenses of her upbringing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, she&#39;s mine; you can play with her as much as
you like, but I&#39;m going to keep her. She&#39;s the jolliest
thing I ever struck, and I&#39;m going to stick to her. I
saw that policeman Johnnie this morning, and he&#39;s quite
given up hope of finding her people. They&#39;ve hunted
everywhere. I offered him a fiver to cover the business,
but he would not touch the money. He says the chief
of police at Tokyo knows you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
&quot;Weel does he know me, seven year and more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he says there&#39;s no objection to our taking her
along to Nagasaki if you give your bond that she will
be looked after, so I was thinking of starting to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wull you take her with us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was thinking of leaving her with the &#39;Tortoise&#39;
people till I settle about a place to live in at Nagasaki,
and then coming back to fetch her. She&#39;ll be all right
with them, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, she&#39;ll be right enough,&quot; said Mac, and they
left the gardens of Dai Nichi Do, and headed for the
hostelry.</p>

<p class="indent">That night the Areopagus convened itself again, and
M&#39;Gourley explained matters. It was necessary that he
and his honorable friend should go to Nagasaki, and
they proposed that the Lost One should be left behind
at the Tea House of the Tortoise, to be kept till called
for, warehoused, in short, and, of course, paid for accordingly.
Was Madame Ranunculus willing?</p>

<p class="indent">Most willing.</p>

<p class="indent">A sum of money would be placed in the landlord&#39;s
hands as guarantee.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, that was perfectly unnecessary!</p>

<p class="indent">Still, the Hon. Leslie wished it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
Accordingly, a sum equivalent almost to the value of
the Tea House of the Tortoise, was placed in the landlord&#39;s
hands, who placed it in numerous folds of rice
paper, and handed it to his wife, who engulfed it in her
kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">These matters having been satisfactorily settled,
Campanula was led off to bed and dinner was served.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning at eight o&#39;clock two rikshas arrived to
take the travelers to the station. The whole of the
&quot;Tortoise&quot; folk, Hedgehog San included, came to the
front of the house. The cry, &quot;Sayonara&mdash;come again
quickly,&quot; followed them as they swept round the pond
and out at the gate, a cry made up of the landlord&#39;s
croaking basso, the sweet voices of the Mousm&egrave;s, and
Campanula&#39;s childish treble.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She seemed sorrier to part with old Mac than me,&quot;
thought Leslie as they span along. &quot;Ugh!&quot; He turned
his head in disgust from an English tourist in tweeds,
who was engaged in kodaking a temple.</p>

<p class="indent">In the train, with a pipe in his mouth and M&#39;Gourley
opposite to him, he felt as if he had just stepped out
of a dream; a dream of sun and splendor, a dream in
which figured camellia trees twenty feet high, and the
form of the Lost One standing amidst the glory of
crimson azaleas.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
But another picture obtruded itself upon this pleasant
dream.</p>

<p class="indent">Away in the mountains not far from Lake Chuzenji,
a green thing had been discovered, a thing that had
once been a man. Mac had been to view it at the request
of the police, but he could not identify it as the body of
the Blind One of the Nikko Road. It was green from
the chlorophyll of the cryptomerias. In the quaint
language of the Japanese police, it was the body of a
man whom &quot;the trees had beaten to death.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h2">THE HOUSE OF THE CLOUDS</p>

<p class="indent">Danjuro, the curio dealer of Jinrikisha Street,
Nagasaki (no relation of Danjuro the actor),
was a gentleman of uncertain age, with a face which
seemed the relic of a thousand years of debauchery.</p>

<p class="indent">It was probably only opium, but the awful weary
look with which he swindled you, when you were once in
the trap he called his shop, would have given Dante
points for the construction of a new circle in his <i>Inferno</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">He had spent years in China, had Danjuro, hence,
perhaps, the expression on his face; also the fact that
he did his calculations not by aid of the so-ro-ba, or
calculating machine used by the Japanese tradesmen. He
did his calculations in his head, and with that far-away
look so filled with the poetry of the horrible, he would
calculate the difference between the price he had paid
for the okimono he was selling you and your offer for
it, contrasting them with your own personality, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
from these three factors calculating to a nicety how
much money he could swindle out of you.</p>

<p class="indent">He had a hand in the selling of the Great Tung Jade
to the Empress of China, or rather to her ambassador
the Mandarin Li, the shadiest transaction that ever
emerged from darkness; and could you place end to end
the globe trotters swindled and chiseled and fleeced by
him, they would reach in a noxious line from London to
Newcastle, and maybe further. He had long, polished
finger nails that shone like plate glass, and when you
entered his establishment he advanced, bowed, and
hissed at you by way of welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a rogue, yet he was straight in his way. To
be a perfect rogue, at least to succeed in the art, you
must be straight in some ways. The bandit who betrays
his brethren never goes far without a dagger sticking
in his back.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley had &quot;discovered&quot; Danjuro years ago.
M&#39;Gourley had twice come to financial smash, once
because of an earthquake, and again in the upheaval
caused by the breaking of the Barings. Danjuro had
helped him twice, and he had helped Danjuro many
times; helped him with his Western craft, Scotch cuteness,
and knowledge of Europeans.</p>

<p class="indent">In every city of the East, in every city of the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
you will find a fixed Scot always prospering; M&#39;Gourley
was a floating Scot. Navigating Japan from end to
end, now at Tokyo, now at Kioto, now at Nagasaki,
crossing to Corea and pottering about there, meeting
brither Scotchmen and helping them in trade
speculations, selling, or assisting in the sale, of
everything sellable from coals to kakemonos, went
M&#39;Gourley, a busy man, but somehow a rather unfortunate
one.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Japan rose and smashed China, Russia
stepped in and robbed her of the pieces, and Japan sat
down, drew her kimono round her, and began to think
about Russia.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley just then (it was some two years before
he met Leslie) was on the Lao-Tung peninsula, a black
wandering dot, innocuous to governments, one would
imagine, as a beetle.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly M&#39;Gourley returned to Japan, and the day
after his return a sheaf of documents addressed by a
gentleman named Lessar to a gentleman named Mouravieff
was in the hands of the Japanese Council of
Elders.</p>

<p class="indent">I don&#39;t say anything about the transaction at all; it
is not for me to take away the characters of my characters.
I only know this, that if the Russian Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
had caught Mac just then, they, laboring under,
perhaps, a fantastically wrong impression, would have
done something decidedly unpleasant to him.</p>

<p class="indent">At all events, Mac bought a new suit of reach-me-down
clothes at a native shop in the Honcho Dori at
Yokohama, and got so drunk that three Mousm&egrave;s had
put him to bed, whilst a fourth fanned him, and a
fifth played soothing tunes on a moon-fiddle to exorcise
the demon; and a piece of priceless gold lacquer presented
to Mac by a high official was sold by him to an
American week later for five thousand dollars gold coin&mdash;gold
coin being much more useful than gold lacquer
to a man in Mac&#39;s way of life.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it came about that Mac was a persona grata
with the Japanese Government, and had many little
privileges not enjoyed by ordinary Europeans.</p>

<p class="indent">Danjuro&#39;s shop was situated in Jinriksha Street, a
street like a picture slashed out of the &quot;Arabian
Nights,&quot; a picture that a child had made additions to
with a lead pencil and half spoiled.</p>

<p class="indent">A bowler hat in Jinriksha Street, for instance, is a
thing very much out of place, yet you see many of
them, mostly potted down on the back of Japanese
heads, and making the wearers both frightful and
ridiculous-looking.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
Here passes a Mousm&egrave; under an umbrella, a figure
fashioned seemingly from a rainbow, a figure to bless
the eye and make the heart feel glad. Here stumps
along a thing that once was a Mousm&egrave;, a thing in
European dress&mdash;alas!</p>

<p class="indent">Here you turn from a shop sign in the vernacular,
and across the way, over the booth where cakes reposing
on myrtle branches are sold, &quot;Englis here is spoke,&quot;
blasts your sight.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinrikisha Street, and for Jinrikisha Street read
nearly every other street in sea-board Japan, is a picture,
as I have said, spoiled as if by a meddlesome
English child.</p>

<p class="indent">Danjuro&#39;s shop was all open in front so that you could
come right in past the bronze stork on the tortoise, past
the leaping dragon made of jointed steel, a dragon hard
as adamant yet flexible as india-rubber. Then you met
Danjuro, and he sank towards the floor and hissed at
you by way of welcome. The chief treasures were in
the cellar below, but here was quite enough to feast the
eye of a not too wise amateur, and make the purse jump
in his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">Danjuro had the art of shop-dressing at his finger-ends.
Things always looked better in his establishment
than they did when fetched home.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
People would cry: &quot;Is <i>that</i> the Owari vase I
bought? Why, <i>what has happened to it</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It would be the same vase, but divorced from its surroundings.</p>

<p class="indent">You cannot imagine the effect of a dwarf plum tree
in a green tile pot upon a dragon of steel until you see
them in juxtaposition, nor the strange difference certain
backgrounds make in an Owari vase till you try them.
Danjuro was well up in these subtleties, and this knowledge,
combined with his own personality, lent an added
value to his wares&mdash;twenty per cent. at least.</p>

<p class="indent">Here in the shop of Danjuro, in a semi-twilight,
glimmer demons and beasts in porcelain and bronze.
The frightful face of Akudogi shouts at you from the
wall, the lotus expands over pools in the silent land of
lacquer, and the hundred guinea ivory Mousm&egrave;, ten
inches high, trips beneath her ivory umbrella, ever on
the way to some fanciful pageant that had once existed
in her creator&#39;s dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">Here is a Jap baby, about as big and as round as a
tangerine orange, feeding ducks. Here a little box a
size larger than a walnut. Open it; inside are seated a
man and boy playing some game with dice. The man is
holding the dice cup up preparing to cast; in it are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
dice, every cube separate and real, and each marked with
the proper pips.</p>

<p class="indent">In the shop of Danjuro you are gazing, not upon
bronzes and lacquers, but upon the mind of Japan,
partly made visible. There is here evidence of patience
and labor sufficient to conquer the world, beauty enough
to charm the world, and ferocity enough to terrify it.</p>

<p class="indent">There is nothing so strange on earth as this art that
reveals in glimpses the exquisite and the awful, where
the lily blossoms and the dragon tramples it under foot.</p>

<p class="indent">That baby feeding the ducks, could anything be more
laughable or lovable? But do not open the drawers of
the cabinet he is standing on: they are filled with ivory
obscenities carved with just as loving care.</p>

<p class="indent">No, the kakemonos and bronzes that adorn the drawing-rooms
of Bayswater and Bedford Park do not disclose
the whole of Japanese art. If you don&#39;t believe me,
then go to Japan and become a friend of Danjuro the
curio-dealer, who lives in Jinrikisha Street, in the quaint
city of Nagasaki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s no use talking,&quot; said Leslie, the second day
after his arrival at Nagasaki. &quot;I don&#39;t want to live in
the European quarter. I want that white house up on
the hill there you said was empty, and I want to buy it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
&quot;Weel,&quot; said Mac&mdash;they were standing in Danjuro&#39;s
shop consulting&mdash;&quot;I&#39;m thinking you want more than
it&#39;s likely y&#39;ll get. You cannot buy the house&mdash;rent it,
maybe. Stay till I ask Dan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan and he had a consultation, the upshot of which
was that the curio-dealer, after a cynical declaration to
the effect that anything could be obtained for money,
offered his services as an intermediary.</p>

<p class="indent">A friend of his, a brother dealer, a Mr. Initogo, or
some such name, owned the house up there on the
heights; he would probably let it. It was named the
House of the Clouds, warranted rainproof and free
from ghosts.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Initogo was fetched from across the way&mdash;a
gentleman in horn spectacles, who looked as wise as
Confucius but was a little bit deaf. After some five
minutes&#39; polite bawling on the part of Mac and Danjuro,
Mr. Initogo came to understand the matter, and
at once declared with a thousand protestations of regret
that the thing was impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">Why?</p>

<p class="indent">Well, he could not allege any specific reason. The
House of the Clouds was empty, but he had not considered
the matter of letting it. The proposition came as
an honorable shock to him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
Then Mac and Danjuro tackled Mr. Initogo, tea was
brought forth, and after half an hour&#39;s wavering Mr.
Initogo began to give in.</p>

<p class="indent">He sent for his son, and piloted by the son, the two
Scotchmen went off to inspect the House of the Clouds.</p>

<p class="indent">They passed up a by-street and then up a steep path,
till they came to a gate shadowed by lilac trees. The
gate led to a tiny demesne, a long, white, two-storied
house, before which lay a grass plot, at the far end of
the house some cherry trees, and a space that might be
used as a garden.</p>

<p class="indent">From the veranda of the House of the Clouds one
could look down on Nagasaki and the harbor that
pierces the land like a crooked sword. The hum of Jinrikisha
Street came up, mixed with the eternal song of
the cicalas.</p>

<p class="indent">Across the harbor, where the junks and sampans contrasted
strangely with the foreign shipping, hills rose
up, green near the water, brown further off; over the
hills a few white fleecy clouds passed on the light wind.
It was the sky of an English summer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like this,&quot; said Leslie, turning from the view.
&quot;Now let&#39;s look at the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was furnished with primrose-colored matting, nothing
else, and it was about as substantial as a bandbox.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
There were two stories connected by a flight of steps
without a balustrade, and you could make as many rooms
as you liked with sliding panels.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll take it,&quot; said Leslie, and they returned to the
shop of Danjuro. Mr. Initogo was fetched, and after
more wriggling and haggling and tea-drinking and the
smoking of tiny pipes, he consented to let the place&mdash;the
authorities willing.</p>

<p class="indent">Mac undertook to make everything right in that respect,
though it would cost him a good deal of trouble,
as the government have a holy horror of foreigners
spreading beyond the allotted quarters; and then a Chinese
comprador was obtained, and received orders from
Leslie to furnish the place with the necessary futons
(he determined to live in the native way), pots, tins, kettles,
Mousm&egrave;s, and a decent cook; also screens and mosquito-nets,
plum trees in pots, and everything else that
might be necessary for comfort and adornment.</p>

<p class="indent">Three days later the comprador appeared at the Nagasaki
hotel, where Leslie was staying, and declared that
everything was in order&mdash;even to the last tea-cup. He
had hired servants, made a most advantageous bargain:
he had hired a whole family.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, bless my soul! I don&#39;t want a family,&quot; said
Leslie. &quot;I only want a cook and a couple of girls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
Just so. This family consisted of a cook&mdash;her name
was Fir-cone&mdash;and three daughters. They would all
come together or not at all; he had got them at a bargain.
The names of the daughters were: Moon, Plum-blossom,
and Snow. Sixteen shillings a month a-piece
was the wages they were promised. There was also a cat
belonging to this family&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well, I&#39;ll take them,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;and if they
don&#39;t suit I can get others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon, preceded by the comprador and followed
by two coolies carrying his luggage he went up
to take formal possession, and was received by his new
servants all on their knees&mdash;the three Mousm&egrave;s in front
and mother Fir-cone in the background.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day he started on the long journey to Nikko
to fetch Campanula. When he returned with his charge
the first person to meet him on the quay was Mac. Mac
in a stove pipe hat he had bought cheap and which did
not fit him but of which he seemed proud. Campanula
instantly recognized Mac with a smile and an attempt
to kow-tow before him, which Leslie frustrated, on account
of the dirty state of the quay. It was a pretty
little incident, and went to the old fellow&#39;s heart.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h2">OF MOUSM&Egrave;S AND OTHER THINGS</p>

<p class="indent">Plum-blossom was a Mousm&egrave; with a broad face,
ever lit by a half smile. Moon was a girl with a
serious expression, but gorgeous of dress as any girl of
Kioto. Snow looked shrunk&mdash;not withered, you understand,
fresh as a daisy, in fact; but something had
happened in her development: she was preternaturally
small, and looked like a Mousm&egrave; seen through a diminishing
glass.</p>

<p class="indent">The three Mousm&egrave;s and old mother Fir-cone took
almost entire possession of Campanula San when she
arrived, and Campanula San seemed quite content.</p>

<p class="indent">Mixed with her charming childishness there was a
philosophical calm that would have done honour to a
sage of the Stoic school.  Riding on Leslie&#39;s shoulder
through Nikko, under examination at the Tea House of
the Tortoise, playing with Plum-blossom in the veranda
of the House of the Clouds, she was just the same.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
Life was a pageant at which she was an humble spectator,
whose duty was to be amiable and submissive, and
accept things just as they came.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not say this, but she acted it, or rather expressed
it in her actions and ways.</p>

<p class="indent">Down on the Bund an office had been rented by
M&#39;Gourley. He slept there and lived there, ascending
occasionally at night to the House of the Clouds to
smoke a pipe with his partner and talk business, and
give advice on things Japanese, advice often needful
enough to the uninitiated Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">House-keeping in Japan is full of surprises. One
day, for instance, Leslie met a figure coming from the
back part of the premises&mdash;a figure like a rag-doll that
had spent its life in a coal-scuttle. Interrogated, the
figure turned out to be the mother of Moon, and by
profession&mdash;well, her profession was helping to coal the
Canadian Pacific boats.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;it is impossible, for Moon
already has a mother whose name is Fir-cone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was just going to send for the police when the
whole truth came out on the veranda, in the form of
Moon herself.</p>

<p class="indent">She explained in indifferent English, kneeling as she
spoke with the backs of her little hands held upwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
to her face, that the comprador had lied; that there was
no particular connection between her and her fellow-servants;
that the comprador had made a bunch of
them just as he might make a bunch of weeds, picking
one up here and the other there, and pretending they
were all the one family. Why had he done this thing?
Who could say? For some dark reason of his own.
She said also that her mother was not always as dirty
as that, but was going home now to wash. Would Leslie
San like to see her washed so that Moon&#39;s words might
be proved to him true? Leslie San would not.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley was had up, and managed to arrange matters
without the disruption of the household, which
seemed imminent.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley mixed a good deal in the affairs of the
House of the Clouds. Six months had not passed before
the member of the Wee Kirk declared that Campanula
should be sent to the missionary day school near the
Bund, and brought up a Christian.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie at first demurred. The state of Campanula&#39;s
mind, as revealed by her in conversations mostly translated
by Mac, but often conducted limpingly by Leslie
himself (he was beginning to pick up the native), did
not argue a good foundation for a structure like the
Christian religion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Her mind, as far as he could get at it, was the mind
of a sensitive and cultured lady who was slightly mad&mdash;mad
on the subject of demons and strange beasts.</p>

<p class="indent">Tortoises who talked, storks whose language was the
acme of politeness, and toads of polished speech, seemed
as real to her as ordinary folk.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether the tin-smith, her supposed father, had filled
her head with these things, no one can say, but the fact
remained that she was a perfect Uncle Remus as far as
animal-tale construction was concerned, and had a Mrs.
Radcliffe touch in the weird, so that it was a not uncommon
thing for her to be marched off to bed, the
triumvirate of Mousm&egrave;s&mdash;Moon, Plum-blossom, and
Snow&mdash;acting as a body-guard to protect her from her
own extraordinary fancies.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the self-abasement, the absolute self-abasement
with which she would kow-tow with both tiny hands
backs upward before your august self, and next minute
she would be spinning a top on the veranda, or playing
just like an ordinary child with Kiku San, a dot about
her own size, and only daughter of Mr. Initogo, the
landlord.</p>

<p class="indent">She had a whole host of baldheaded Pagan friends,
male and female, and Leslie, taking a siesta of an afternoon,
would hear their clogs rattling on the veranda, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
their naked feet pattering in the kitchen, and half
fancy himself the proprietor of a kindergarten.</p>

<p class="indent">Quaint kites were often to be seen flying above the
House of the Clouds, kites shaped like hawks and butterflies,
and M&#39;Gourley down in the street below would
sometimes glance up and see these evidences of Campanula&#39;s
existence, and nod his head and say, &quot;A&#39;weel!&quot;
and hurry on to Danjuro&#39;s to meet him about some perhaps
questionable transaction, revolving in his mind
the while the question of Campanula&#39;s conversion to
Christianity.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a strange mixture. He would spend a whole
morning in trade. That is to say, he would get to the
office on the Bund early, do his correspondence and
what not with regard to the export of cheap curios, go
to the hotel and have a cocktail, and fish round for victims;
find some well-to-do stranger and lead him into
Danjuro&#39;s shop, deliver him up as a dripping roast
into Danjuro&#39;s hands, receive his commission, and go off
and have tiffin. Then as likely as not he would go up
to the House of the Clouds and fetch Campanula out
for a walk, and buy her toys, or sweets, or flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">And once a week or so he would tackle Leslie about
the Christianity business, till Leslie at last gave in.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula went to the missionary day school, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
prettiest school child in the world under her scarlet
umbrella pictured with flying storks.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie went away sometimes for weeks, leaving her
in charge of the Mousm&egrave;s and leaving Mac with instructions
to keep an eye on her welfare.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first eight months or so of this new life he
was amused and interested, the beauty of the country,
the quaintness of the people, the new conditions of life,
kept him from thinking much about the past or troubling
about the future.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came reaction. A craving came on him to see
England once again, a veritable home-sickness that was
not to be denied.</p>

<p class="indent">He made a journey to London. He only spent a
fortnight there; every one he had known in the past
was either gone or dead. He belonged to no club. It was
a miserable fortnight, and every day of it Japan called
him back.</p>

<p class="indent">When he returned, he told himself that he had done
with the West for ever. Just as men sometimes tell
themselves they have done for ever with sin, folly, or
love.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h2">THE DREAM</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;Jap Rubbish trade&quot; was prospering mildly.</p>

<p class="indent">During the first two years it seemed likely to languish
and die, but in the third year it woke up, got on
its legs, and, to use M&#39;Gourley&#39;s phrase, &quot;began to
pick a bit.&quot; In the fourth year it was bringing Leslie in
some two hundred a year, a fair amount considering the
capital originally invested in it.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that he wanted the money, he kept his interest in
the thing just for something to do&mdash;a toy business to
play with when he was otherwise disengaged.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Mac, he was getting rich, not out of the
Rubbish trade, but in a manner we will hint at later
on.</p>

<p class="indent">The House of the Clouds remained unaltered, save
for a tiny landscape garden not much bigger than a
dining-table which Leslie had laid out for Campanula.
It lay beyond the garden walk in front of the veranda,
and it had mountains and rivers and savannas of moss,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
and old oak trees, fierce-looking, but not much bigger
than your thumb, and twisted fir trees that reflected
themselves gloomily in lakes the size of hand-mirrors,
and a Shinto temple about the size of a Buszard&#39;s Dundee
cake; there were also bridges across the rivers.</p>

<p class="indent">The thing had been laid out as a New Year&#39;s gift for
Campanula, and it had cost Leslie about the price of a
Steinway Grand.</p>

<p class="indent">Azalea bushes grew right up to it, azaleas bordered
the house, and there was a wilderness of azaleas in the
open space near the cherry trees.</p>

<p class="indent">Crimson azaleas, imported all the way from the
azalea valley at Nikko in the very first year of Leslie&#39;s
residence in Nagasaki. It was a pretty thought, and it
had cost a good penny, and caused much grumbling
from Mac, and great admiration in Mr. Initogo, who
had turned out the most delightful of landlords, a good
hand at whist, and most adaptable about repairs. He
was a modern Japanese agnostic when he was well, was
Mr. Initogo, and a Shinto when he was ill or in trouble;
but he was an all-round good landlord at all times.</p>

<p class="indent">One bright afternoon Leslie was seated beneath the
cherry trees in a deck chair, his hat tilted back, and the
pipe he had just been smoking lying on the ground at
his feet. He was asleep. Lately he had been suffering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
from a touch of fever and chills caught on a duck-shooting
expedition down the coast; he had been taking
opium for it, and now as he sat beneath the cherry trees
the opium was troubling his dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">Just before dropping off, his eye had fallen on a
single azalea blossom that had burst into flame, as if
spring had just touched off with her torch the fire
of crimson flowers that soon would blaze round the
house.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he fell asleep, and Opium plucked the crimson
blossom, and followed him with it into the land of
dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">He was in a Hongwanji temple, and there were people
there, Europeans seemingly, dressed in European
clothes; but though in a specious disguise, they were
soon perceived to be not the people of this earth. They
had strange and distorted faces, and forms that surely
never were made in God&#39;s image. One man, who suddenly
hid himself behind a screen of lacquer, Leslie could have
sworn was made of stone.</p>

<p class="indent">Then in great tribulation of spirit he was escaping
from the company of these people, passing down a corridor
where soft matting took the foot; but something
was following him with a hissing sound, a sound such as
Danjuro made by way of welcome when you entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
his shop. Of a sudden the opium spirit touched the corridor
wall with the flower he had been patiently carrying,
the Hongwanji temple vanished, and Leslie found
himself on the Nikko road.</p>

<p class="indent">The valley of azaleas lay before him and the mournful
cypress trees, the country where the moving clouds
cast their shadows, and the far blue hills beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">There was something moving amidst the azaleas.
He knew it was a child, but, by some curious and subtle
freak of the opium fiend, the child was hidden from him,
all but vague glimpses; were it to make itself half visible
for a second a phantom azalea bush would come before
it, but he could see a tiny white hand busy plucking
the crimson blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent">Then from somewhere far away through the dream
came the mournful toot, toot, of a blind man&#39;s reed-pipe.
At first it seemed beyond the bend of the road,
and then it seemed amidst the azaleas, and then in the
wood of cypress trees. It grew more insistent and piercing,
and changed subtly into the sound he had once
heard on the Nikko road when, sitting with M&#39;Gourley,
he had listened to the tune of the blind juggler with
the pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">As he listened, shuddering, he saw something which he
at once knew to be the reason of the music and the soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
of the opium drama that was unfolding before him.</p>

<p class="indent">A tiny black dot was visible in the sky away over the
distant hills. It expanded and grew, dilated as if in response
to the enchanted music. And then he saw that
it was a bird; a vast bird, larger than an eagle, a ferocious
and awful bird, a tragic apparition called up from
the lands of night. It poised above the valley, seeming
to float and be upborne, not on air, but on the music
welling from the wood.</p>

<p class="indent">He knew that if he could get to the half-seen child
amidst the azaleas he could save it from its fate. But
he could make no movement nor utter a sound, but stood
paralyzed, watching the tiny white hand plucking the
crimson flowers and the Horror above preparing to
strike.</p>

<p class="indent">The music had now turned to a drone, a sound like
the spinning sound of a vast top. The thing in the air
circled and span. He knew it was preparing to fall like
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he awoke.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw the garden, the cherry trees, the house.
Opium land had vanished, but the music remained, ringing
in his ears; or was it real?</p>

<p class="indent">He sprang to his feet and staggered along the path
leading to the gate looking wildly round him and listening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
As he came, the sound died off; died and turned to
the sound of ordinary life, the hum from the city below,
the sound of the wind in the lilac trees, the tune of
ceaseless cicalas.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My God! what a dream!&quot; he muttered as he
grasped the gate and stared down the lilac-shadowed
path. Then he returned slowly to the seat beneath the
cherry trees, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">Opium had played a trick upon him like this before.
He had taken it first months ago for fever; since then he
had taken it occasionally for the slightest ache. He reacted
well to it sensually speaking, and found it at once
soothing and stimulating. Once before it had pushed
him into dreamland, but a dreamland without plot or
plan, and unstained by a horror such as he had just
witnessed.</p>

<p class="indent">He was seated half drowsing, when suddenly some influence
made him look up and he saw before him a
lovely thing. It was Campanula. She had just come
out of the house by way of the veranda, and was
approaching him. Campanula, far removed from the
child he had carried on his shoulder into Nikko five
years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">The child had turned into a girl with that rapidity
of transformation characteristic of the women of Japan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
She was taller than the ordinary Mousm&egrave; of fourteen or
fifteen; her face, even to Western eyes, was beautiful
with a sad and mysterious beauty of its own, and her
every movement was graceful as the movement of a bluebell
when touched by the wind.</p>

<p class="indent">She had ceased to attend the mission school after
nearly four years&#39; instruction, during which she had
grasped the art of speaking and almost of thinking in
English, and was now Leslie&#39;s housekeeper, his adopted
daughter, and absolute ruler of the small domain known
as the House of the Clouds&mdash;as far, that is to say, as
the household affairs went.</p>

<p class="indent">She still retained her childishness of mind, and for all
the Christian endeavor of the missionaries, she still retained
much of her pristine belief in &quot;things&quot;&mdash;things
with wings as well as hoofs, things that lived in woods,
birds that talked, and beasts that made answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Though she could speak English, she never spoke
in long sentences, or told a connected tale in that language,
always falling back on the vernacular when her
imagination was roused, or a long and connected statement
had to be made.</p>

<p class="indent">She was approaching Leslie now with a porcelain
bowl figured with storks in her hand, and a smile upon
her face. There was little mat on the ground near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
his chair, and on this she sat down&mdash;kneeling fashion&mdash;with
the bowl before her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See!&quot; said she, producing some things like small
gun wads from the sleeve of her kimono, &quot;I bought
these to-day to give you pleasure. Oh, so beautiful!
Watch!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She cast one of the ugly discs upon the surface of
the water. It lay there for a moment unchanged, and
then, as if by magic, began to expand as it sucked up
the fluid, and break up, growing bigger and broader
till at last on the surface of the water floated three pink-tinted
lotus-flowers, a most delicate and perfect resemblance
of the real things.</p>

<p class="indent">She folded her hands and looked up at him with a
happy smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you get them?&quot; asked Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;M&#39;Gourley San told me of them, he wished to buy
them for me&mdash;but I bought them for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She removed the lotus-flowers and cast another disc
on the water.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie watched her. During the last few months Campanula&#39;s
attitude to him had changed. From a happy,
humble, and somewhat heedless thing&mdash;a creature that
regarded him with affection&mdash;an affection of about the
same strength as she exhibited for M&#39;Gourley, Sweetbriar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
San, the cat, and her children schoolmates; she
had become a follower of his alone, always striving to
please him, forestalling his wants, always happy in his
presence, and drooping&mdash;unknown to him&mdash;when he
was away.</p>

<p class="indent">The second wad under the influence of the water
broke up and began to form the branch of a cherry
tree covered with blossom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arashiyama,&quot; murmured she, folding her small
hands and speaking dreamily, as if communing with
herself. Then she sat watching the branch of the cherry
tree expanding over the surface of the water.</p>

<p class="indent">From the house came a somewhat discordant voice
singing a song about a bee and a lilac bough.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Pine-breeze singing at her work. Moon, Plum-blossom,
and Snow, with their fictitious mother Fir-cone,
had vanished from the House of the Clouds two years
and more, giving place to Pine-breeze, a miracle of
daintiness and prettiness, and two other Mousm&egrave;s, one
&quot;rather old,&quot; the cook, Lotus-bud by name, and the
other named Cherry-blossom, as pretty as Pine-breeze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen!&quot; said Campanula, suddenly looking up from
the bowl and its contents. &quot;There is some one at the
gate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie half turned.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
A man and woman had passed through the gateway
shadowed by lilac, a short, stout man dressed in tweed
and a tall woman in blue serge.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie could see them only indistinctly from where
he sat, and they, not looking in his direction, failed
to see him at all.</p>

<p class="indent">They were coming up to the veranda when the
woman turned to the little picture garden, laughed, and
pointed it out to her companion. Then she left the path,
stepped gingerly right into the middle of the landscape
garden country, and tried to pluck up an oak tree, a
gnarled and ancient-looking oak tree eight inches high.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot; asked Campanula, turning from the sight
of this outrage with uplifted forefinger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are Foreign Devils,&quot; said Leslie using the
Chinese idiom. He was very pale, leaning forward in
chair. &quot;Look, Campanula! I verily believe she is trying
to tear up your mountains to see how they grow. That&#39;s
what they call in England &#39;cheek,&#39; Campanula.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE FOREIGN DEVILS</p>

<p class="indent">The female Foreign Devil having failed to uproot
the oak, which clung to its native soil with a
tenacity highly Japanese, returned to the garden path.
And then came the voice of Pine-breeze kow-towing to
the strangers, bidding them welcome, and imploring
them to make the honorable entrance.</p>

<p class="indent">They passed from view into the house, and Leslie rose
from his chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait here awhile, Campanula,&quot; he said, &quot;and then
follow me in. I think I know them, but I will go and
see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked to the house and kicked his garden shoes
off in the veranda, noting the fact that the Foreign
Devils had committed the unspeakable outrage of entering
with their shoes on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Richard!</i>&quot; cried the tall woman, advancing to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
with outstretched hand as he entered the room where
they were. &quot;Why, you&#39;ve grown!&quot; She spoke as
though they had parted yesterday, but her voice had an
hysterical quaver, then she presented her cheek to him
for a cousinly kiss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Richard Leslie,&quot; said the woman, turning
to the little stout man in tweed. &quot;We grew up together;
that&#39;s why I&#39;m so tall, I suppose. Dick&mdash;my
husband George. Gracious, Dick, where are your chairs
and things? Have you nothing to sit down on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only the floor,&quot; said Leslie, fetching some square
cushions and placing them on the matting. &quot;See, this
is how it&#39;s done,&quot; and he sat down on one of the cushions,
whilst his companions followed suit.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane du Telle, once Jane Deering, was, despite her
vivacity and carelessness of manner, evidently in a state
of high nervous tension.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie, notwithstanding the years that had passed
since their last meeting, saw in her mentally little
change. She was the same Jane who had once hacked
his shins, when they were boy and girl together, up in
Scotland, and then flung herself on his neck in a burst of
repentance and tears. Emotional, good-hearted, selfish&mdash;giving
herself away one moment, but always saved
the next by a latent discretion that was to her flighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
nature as a gyroscope. The same Jane with whom he
had fished for salmon and played at tennis in the past,
seated before him now on a floor in Japan, chattering
of everything and nothing just in the old familiar way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that&#39;s the fellow she has married!&quot; thought
he, as he glanced across at George du Telle, a podgy,
red-headed little man, a globe-trotting Briton of the
most blatant description.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you know I was here?&quot; asked he, after
Jane had somewhat talked her hysterical feelings off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Channing told us last night at the hotel. He&#39;s
a friend of yours. He told us he knew an Englishman
named Richard Leslie living in the native fashion, and
I asked him if he was good-looking and tall and dark,
and he said, &#39;Yes.&#39; He said you lived at the House of the
Clouds&mdash;sounds like an address in a dream, doesn&#39;t it?&mdash;so
we took rikshas and came.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put her hand to her back, where the &quot;floor
stitch&quot; had seized her. The floor may be a convenient
enough resting-place for a Mousm&egrave; who sinks down
upon it quite naturally in the likeness of a compressed
and joyously colored Z, but for an English woman of
five feet eight or more, dressed in a tailor-made gown,
and laced in a <i>corset parfait</i> it is at first rather difficult.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would have got chairs,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;if I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
known you were coming; but of all the people of the
world, you were the last I expected to see. Where did
you come from? I mean, how did you strike Nagasaki?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We came from Colombo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beastly hole,&quot; put in her husband, who was stroking
Sweetbriar San, the cat of the establishment, who had
just come in to inspect the strangers. &quot;We stayed at
the Beach Hotel two nights, and d&#39;you know what they
charged us? Just think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t think,&quot; said Jane, who had wriggled into a
more comfortable attitude. &quot;Give me that cat, George;
and I wish you would try to repress your hotel bills.
Dick, I was so sorry to hear the news about your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What news?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About his death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you were sorrier than I was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Dick! but don&#39;t let us talk about it, it&#39;s all so
sad. And have you been living here in Japan ever
since?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ever since.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just like this on the floor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just like this on the floor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must find it rather flat, I should think,&quot; said
the carroty-headed George.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Richard,&quot; said Jane suddenly, ignoring her husband,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
&quot;you&#39;re not married to a Japanese&mdash;or anything&mdash;are
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you live here alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I have three servant girls, and a daughter, if
you call that &#39;alone.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A daughter!&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; and she&#39;s Japanese, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Japanese!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I adopted her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">George du Telle snorted, and fortunately at that moment
a panel slid back, and Pine-breeze appeared with
the tea, followed by Lotus-bud with an hibachi and
Cherry-blossom with a heap of tiny plates.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are these your&mdash;I mean is one of these your&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Daughter? No. Turn round, and you will see her,&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was seated with her back to the drawn-back
panel that made a doorway on to the veranda. She
turned, and there in the sunlit space stood Campanula
in her blue kimono, broad scarlet obi, and with a scarlet
flower in her hair. Behind her, as a background, lay
the picture garden, antique hills, spun-glass torrents,
and tiny, twisted fir trees, that looked, oh, so old, and
tired of the world, and tormented by the wind.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula went right down on her knees upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
matting, and murmured the usual Japanese welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">Now this was a practice that Leslie disliked. He had
tried to break her of it, and in the attempt he had come
across a strange fact.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula in her heart of hearts was a real child
of Old Japan. She might have been a sister to the seven-and-forty
Ronins in the time before Osaka was defiled
by factory chimneys, and the monastery of Kotoku-in
by the presence of Cook&#39;s tourists.</p>

<p class="indent">She tried honestly to be modern, as it was the wish
of Leslie, but in times of emotion, back her intellect
would go to Old Japan, and she would act as her ancestors
had acted in who knows what lotus-strewn and
blossom-scented ages.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does she say?&quot; asked Jane, as George du
Telle rose to his feet. &quot;Tell me, and ask her to excuse
me for not getting up, for when I get up, I&#39;ll have
to be <i>pulled</i> up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is bidding you welcome and at the same time
apologizing for the fact of her own miserable existence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I accept the apology,&quot; said Jane, as Campanula,
her devotions over, sank down before the tea-service,
and prepared to act as hostess. &quot;Freely and frankly,
Dick, I must congratulate you on your taste&mdash;she is
lovely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula looked up with a faint, apologetic smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I speak English,&quot; she said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE MONASTERY GARDEN</p>

<p class="indent">Jane gazed over Nagasaki, the blue water, the
green hills, to the blue beyond, and sighed. They
were standing near the gate; tea was over, and they
were waiting for Campanula, who had gone into the
house to make some alteration in her dress before accompanying
them &quot;down town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Richard,&quot; she said, &quot;take us somewhere where we
can talk, you and I. I have such a heap of things to
ask you and talk about. Twelve years&mdash;can it be twelve
years since we last saw each other? Did you get my last
letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">George du Telle was standing near smoking a cigar,
and staring at the beautiful view with about the same
amount of interest he would have felt had it been a
soap advertisement, but she did not lower her voice.
She was perfectly frank with the world and her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">This frankness carried her far, and enabled her sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
to skate on ice that would have given under many
a woman of half her weight, for it was a genuine frankness,
not a thing put on.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a person whom women called nice-looking on
first acquaintance, and men mentally registered as plain.
Tall, pale, with an excellent figure, and gray eyes. A
man met her and spoke to her, and found her plain but
very jolly, increased the acquaintanceship and found her
plainness vanishing, and then, all of a sudden, his foolish
soul was caught in a trap.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the magic of her lips, perhaps. They formed
the true Cupid&#39;s bow, full, and seemingly cut by a chisel
wielded by a master hand, sensitive and sensuous.
Gazing at them one came to understand how in the ancient
world tall Troy fell before a kiss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which letter?&quot; asked Leslie, plucking a lilac spray
and strewing the ground with the tiny petals.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one I wrote six years ago telling you I was
married. I sent it care of your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Leslie gloomily. &quot;I have heard from
no one for eight years and more. I cut the world, you
know&mdash;or it cut me rather; but I&#39;ll tell you some other
time, here&#39;s Campanula.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then they started, Leslie and his companion leading
the way.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
&quot;Where are you going to take us?&quot; asked Jane,
when they had reached the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Through the city to a place I know on a hill,&quot; replied
Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">He had called four rikshas from the stand, and he
gave some directions to the riksha men, and they
started.</p>

<p class="indent">You cannot imagine the size of Nagasaki till you
drive through it in a swift-running riksha, nor the
quaintness, nor the terror that causes your heart to fly
upwards as your riksha man shaves a baby, not with a
razor, but with the off wheel.</p>

<p class="indent">Boy babies fighting tops, girls bouncing colored
balls, flights of children whose clogs clatter like the
dominoes in an Italian restaurant as they pursue each
other in some mysterious game&mdash;everywhere children, a
shifting, colored maze in which the eye gets tangled and
lost. Babies, temples, tea-houses, streets upon streets of
houses that look as if you could flatten them out with
the blows of a shovel, bursts of cherry-blossoms, tripping
Mousm&egrave;s, stone monsters, awful, yet pathetic with
the gray of lichen and the green of moss, a courtyard
with a twisted fir tree leaning across it, laughter, and
the tune of a <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> running through it all, that is the
impression that a riksha ride through Nagasaki in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
spring would leave on the mind, were not the picture
blurred by the European element.</p>

<p class="indent">Street after street they passed through, and still
the mysterious city kept building up streets before them.
Leslie had thought of taking his companions to the
O Suwa, but he had changed his mind and given other
directions to the riksha men.</p>

<p class="indent">They passed up a steep incline, dark with fir trees,
and drew up at a great gateway consisting of two joists
of wood supporting a vast beam, the whole making a
figure something in the fashion of the Greek II.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond the gateway lay an inclined path, bordered
by cryptomeria trees, leading to the fa&ccedil;ade of a temple.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a place I sometimes come to,&quot; said Leslie, as
he helped Jane to descend. &quot;It&#39;s quiet, and worth seeing
in its way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula and George du Telle led the way this
time, Leslie and his companion leisurely following.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come down this path,&quot; said Jane, turning to a side
alley. &quot;Oh, how pretty! and how mournful too, with
those rows of dark trees. Dick, this is not a cemetery
you have brought us to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; it&#39;s a Shinto monastery. Few people know it,
and it&#39;s out of the run of the general sight-seeing
bounders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
&quot;Things with kodaks?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And without&mdash;but see here, Jane.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s your husband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;George?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I suppose his name is George. What is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s in the wool trade&mdash;he&#39;s the richest man in the
wool trade, they say. He thinks and talks of nothing
else but wool. He got off the subject to-day with you
for awhile; wasn&#39;t he brilliant? But we get on all right
together; he has his set, and I have mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is his set?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The very best&mdash;I mean the very worst; the poor old
Smart Set that every one is always beating as if it were
a donkey&mdash;which it is,&quot; said Jane, taking her seat on
the plinth supporting the prancing figure of Ama-ino,
fronted across the walk by the equally fantastic figure
of Koma-ino, a veritable Lion and Unicorn. &quot;Sit down
beside me, Dick, and tell me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have you been doing all these years?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&#39;ve been keeping alive&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick,&quot; suddenly broke out Jane, as if she had not
been listening, &quot;I have often thought you must have
thought me a heartless wretch; but I&#39;m not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
&quot;There is no use in going over the past,&quot; he said.
&quot;What is done is done, and never can be undone. I
can only say that I have never in the past had a friend
to stick to me, or a woman to love me, or a father to care
for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May it not have been your own fault, Dick?
Think for a moment. I don&#39;t want to reproach you, but
you know how wild you were&mdash;you know that was one
of the reasons we couldn&#39;t get married. Oh, it wasn&#39;t
&#39;my heartlessness,&#39; as you told me in your last letter
but one. I have heart enough&mdash;at least I hope so,&quot;
said Jane, looking at Koma-ino as if for confirmation,
&quot;and I wouldn&#39;t have done what I did if you&#39;d been
different. Never mind, Dick, cheer up!&mdash;buck up! as
they used to say in the poor old Smart Set, till the respectable
folk took the expression away from them.
What&#39;ve you been doing all these long years, Dick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve been in Australia.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What were you doing there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Curse Australia!&quot; suddenly broke out Leslie, digging
his heel in the ground. &quot;Don&#39;t speak to me about
it; let&#39;s talk of something else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what are you doing here? I mean, what have
you been doing all these years&mdash;playing the guitar, or
what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m a shopman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I and a man named M&#39;Gourley are in business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two Scotchmen?&quot; sneered Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two Scotchmen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what are you selling&mdash;paper umbrellas?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; and hats and kakemonos, and every other sort
of a mono that the European trade will swallow. We
export them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you&#39;re a merchant, <i>not</i> a shopman,&quot; said
Jane in a half-angry, half-relieved voice. &quot;I <i>wish</i> you
would not give me these sort of horrible shocks. I
thought at first you were serving in some place behind
the counter&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t want to make money in business much;
I do it more for interest and to have an object in life.
I&#39;m well off; my father&#39;s money all came to me&mdash;he
died well off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And wasn&#39;t it queer?&quot; said Jane. &quot;George is awfully
rich, you know; well, directly I was married, old
Aunt Keziah died, and every penny of her money came
to me. Fifty thousand. No, forty-eight thousand, four
hundred and eighty-two pounds, ten and sixpence. It
seemed so sweet, the little sixpence following at the end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
I sent for it, and had a hole drilled through it, and
I always wear it on this bangle&mdash;look!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked; there were many things hanging on the
bangle. He touched a tiny gold pig swinging by a
ring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You</i> gave me that,&quot; said Jane, &quot;and I&#39;ve never
parted with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; said he, fingering a cabalistic-looking
blue stone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s an inkh, I think; I&#39;m not sure of the name.
It&#39;s lucky, or supposed to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who gave it to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A boy at Cairo last winter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old was he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, about twenty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And this?&quot; said Leslie, picking out another charm
in the form of a heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; said Jane, pulling her wrist away, &quot;I
don&#39;t want to waste time like this, I want you to tell
me more about yourself; I want you to tell me about
that child Campanula. <i>Why</i> did you adopt her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I found her on the road going to Nikko.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s away up in Shimotsuke, beyond Tokyo. I and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
M&#39;Gourley were on the tramp. We were sitting by the
roadside resting, when a blind man came along. He was
half mad, and talked wild. Said he was a juggler, and
offered to fetch devils out of a wood near by, if we
gave him gold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you try him?&quot; said Jane in an interested
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did try him,&quot; said Leslie; &quot;gave him some money.
He made a circle in the dust, with signs round the rim
of it, told us not to touch it or come near it, got into
the middle of it, and fetched out a reed-pipe. Then he
began to play a tune that would make you shiver to
hear, and things croaked in the wood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on,&quot; said Jane shivering pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took my walking-stick and made a mark in the
dust just near his foot. I touched his heel by accident,
and&mdash;whew!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He went off like a rocket; bounded out of the circle,
rushed this way and that, knocking against trees
and striking right and left with his stick, as if dogs
were about him. He got round the bend of the road
and vanished. We were pretty much astonished, but
that wasn&#39;t the end of it. In front of us was a valley
of the most beautiful crimson azaleas.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
&quot;Wait a moment, Dick; you&#39;re a very bad story-teller.
You should always stage your characters: you
should have described the azaleas first and the scenery.
Well, go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bother the azaleas!&quot; said Dick. They were fast
getting into the old boy-and-girl way of talking to each
other, a somewhat dangerous language at thirty. &quot;It
doesn&#39;t matter whether they come in first or last. Where
was I? Oh yes. Mac suddenly said: &#39;Look there!&#39; I
looked, and there sure enough was a child amidst the
azaleas. She hadn&#39;t been there a few seconds before, and
Mac would have it that she had been &#39;fetched&#39;; it was
a pretty wild country and no houses around, and there
she was, just as if she had stepped out of a house,
plucking away at the azalea blossoms for all she was
worth, a tiny dot in a blue kimono and scarlet obi. I
stole up behind her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d have caught her up and kissed her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just what I did, in fact; and it may have been
fancy, but she seemed slipping through my fingers like&mdash;grease
till I kissed her, and she became solid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s one thing, Dick, you&#39;ll never make a poet.
Well, go on; it&#39;s awfully interesting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We carried her off to Nikko. No parents could be
found to own her, so I adopted her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
&quot;What became of the juggler?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was a funny thing. As we turned the bend
of the road we saw him away up in a gorge of the
hills. He was still running for all he was worth, beating
about him with his stick as if hitting off devils,
and dashing himself against trees in a quite regardless
manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How awful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, frankly, it was, and it had a sequel, for his
dead body was found miles away some days after, and
the Japanese police said the trees had beaten him to
death, which they practically had.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Dick, what was the meaning of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who knows! When I touched him on the heel perhaps
he may have thought it was a devil seizing him,
and his imagination did the rest. Mac thinks, or, at
least, he once thought&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That there was something developing in the wood,
something bad; that Campanula&#39;s ghost was wandering
in the wood; that when I made the mark I did inside
the circle, the bad thing was flung out of the developing
medium and Campanula&#39;s ghost sucked into it, and
so she became materialized.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the bad thing went for the juggler man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
&quot;It and perhaps others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never heard anything half so horrible, if it&#39;s true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s true enough. I was forgetting it almost, but I
had a horrid dream to-day that brought it all back. I
was sitting in the garden smoking and I dropped off
to sleep; and I heard the sound of that beast&#39;s pipe, and
I saw the place on the Nikko road, and there was a
child amongst the flowers. Then a frightful bird came
along and was going to attack the child, and I awoke&mdash;it
was just before you came.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick, what was the mark you made on the road?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sign of the cross,&quot; said Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was silent for a moment then&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="h2">NAGASAKI BY NIGHT</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t tell me stories like that,&quot;
she suddenly broke out. &quot;I&#39;ll be dreaming
about it all to-night.&quot; She shuddered, and gazed
at Koma-ino. &quot;Japan seems a horribly creepy sort
of place; I think I&#39;ll make George come away to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One side of it,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;is simply crawling;
you have no idea, and I who have lived here five years
have only a glimmering of the mind of the people. Do
you know what I think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that in the sleeves of their kimonos&mdash;I
mean their frock coats, for they&#39;ve put off their kimonos
for a while for business purposes&mdash;they are simply
laughing at us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the English&mdash;at Europe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
&quot;Like their impudence!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s impudence, perhaps not, anyhow&mdash;I
distrust them&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick,&quot; said his companion, &quot;look! It&#39;s getting
dusk: let&#39;s go and look for George and your &#39;adoptive
daughter.&#39; Mercy! What&#39;s that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A deep hum filled the air; it seemed to come at first
from the statue of Koma-ino&mdash;a soul-disturbing hum
that deepened and swelled and then leapt, leapt into a
deafening roar that rushed over Nagasaki, to die on the
distant sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane clung to her companion like a child, hugged him
as a child might hug a nurse; her straw hat was pushed
sideways, and he found his face buried in the masses
of her perfumed hair. His arm had slipped round her
waist, her arm was over his shoulder, and her fingers
pressing his neck; for a moment he felt as if he were
absorbing her being&mdash;drinking her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the sound died away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>What</i> was it?&quot; gasped she, pushing away from
him and gazing at him with a white, drawn face. &quot;Why,
you seem half dazed; you were more frightened than
I. Dick, what was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; said Leslie, in the voice of a man
waking from the effect of an opiate. &quot;I wasn&#39;t frightened. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
It was only the big gong of the monastery; I&#39;ve
heard it lots of times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why couldn&#39;t you have told me?&quot; cried Jane,
flying from fright to fury. &quot;Think what it must have
looked like, you hugging me like that.&quot; She sprang to
her feet. &quot;You bring me here and tell me ghost stories,
and frighten me to death with gongs and things, and
then&mdash;I believe you&#39;re half a Japanese already, you&#39;ve
grown so horrid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There wasn&#39;t any one to see,&quot; said Leslie, rising to
his feet. &quot;And talking about hugging&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about hugging&mdash;talk about
hugging! Do you fancy yourself on Hampstead Heath?
Come, let us find George. I want something common-place
after all this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They found George and Campanula&mdash;the most
strangely matched pair in the world&mdash;waiting for them
at the gates.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll come and dine with us at the hotel, won&#39;t
you?&quot; asked Jane as they got into the rikshas.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll come right enough,&quot; said Leslie. &quot;Wait,
please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went to Campanula&#39;s riksha and asked her, but
she prayed to be honorably excused&mdash;she had a headache.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
She passed her hand across her forehead as if in
confirmation of her words. Leslie tucked the riksha
blanket round her knees, and explained to the Du
Telles, and they started.</p>

<p class="indent">The quaint city they had come through had changed
to a quainter city still. Night had blotted out the traces
of Europe on Nagasaki&mdash;at least, in the purely native
streets. All sorts of strange little trades that sleep in
the daytime had awakened with the dusk. Things queer
in the daytime were now mysterious, and things common,
quaint. The fish shop, with its huge paper lantern,
besides the fish and the sea-weed on its slabs, disposed
of dreams which it flung away gratis to the passing
traveler in the running riksha, and the booth of the
sandal merchant, with the tiny potted rose tree in front
of the wares, became at once an apology and atonement
for all the commonplace villainy condensed in the word
&quot;shop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mousm&egrave;s passed, now half Mousm&egrave;s, half glowworms,
each bearing a colored lantern on the end of a little
stick; and then the shadows half lit by lamp-light, where
a cherry tree was attempting to peep into the street: the
light of lamps glimmering through paper shutters, the
light of lanterns swinging in the wind&mdash;red, blue, white,
and yellow, some pictured with chrysanthemums; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
stork that stands so boldly forth in Japanese pictures
but is nearly gone from Japan, cherry-blossoms, and fish
that seem swimming vigorously in a bowl of water lambent
and green; and then the sounds, ten <i>cham&egrave;cens</i> for
one in the day. The riksha whisks by a booth, whence
comes the squalling of cats&mdash;seemingly. It is the gaku,
Japanese poetry set to music and flung into the lamp-lit
street to make things stranger, and heighten, if possible,
the charm. At the corner of the by-street leading
to the House of the Clouds they met Pine-breeze simply
laden with all sorts of weird and wonderful paper boxes,
and lighting herself on her way with a lantern pictured
with a cuttle-fish and carried on the end of a short bamboo
rod. She had been marketing. It was a fortunate
meeting, for she could escort Campanula home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="h2">M&#39;GOURLEY&#39;S LOVE AFFAIR</p>

<p class="indent">Following Pine-breeze, who went before her like
a fantastically colored glowworm, Campanula ascended
to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">As she stepped onto the veranda she heard the voice
of M&#39;Gourley San addressing Lotus-bed, and asking
when she thought Leslie San would be back. Mac&#39;s
elastic-side boots were in the veranda, and his gamp was
propped against the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">He was sitting on the floor smoking a pipe and reading
the <i>Japan Mail</i> through a pair of spectacles when
Campanula entered.</p>

<p class="indent">Mac often came up of nights like this. He was a vivid
Radical, and Leslie was a hide-bound Conservative, so
they had a splendid time together when they got on
politics; or they would play chess, or Mr. Initogo would
drop in and they would have a rubber of dummy whist.</p>

<p class="indent">But what Mac really came for, though he scarcely
knew it himself, was Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula was a lot to Mac; much more than one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
can express in prose, and M&#39;Gourley is scarcely the
figure to make a ballad of. Yet the poem was there round
about him, unsung, unuttered, unguessed by any one,
least of all by himself.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had made chickens out of orange-pips for
her at Nikko, she just as cunningly had made him her
slave.</p>

<p class="indent">She had taken this dull, hard-grained, and shady old
business man into a byway, of life, and made him spin
tops and fly kites. She had made him admire flowers
and listen to fairy tales, and all as naturally and as
peacefully as though these things had been matters of
everyday occurrence with him the whole long length of
his arid life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Einst, O wunder!</i>&quot;&mdash;that ballad might have been
inspired by Mac&mdash;had the writer ever met him in business
or seen him in the flesh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hech!&quot; said Mac. &quot;There you are; and where
have you been trapsing to this hour of the evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula explained that Leslie had met friends, and
that he had gone to dine with them at the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonder who they can be?&quot; soliloquized Mac, as
Campanula clapped her little hands together for Pine-breeze
to bring refreshments. &quot;Some people he has
picked up at the hotel, maybe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
They sat opposite to each other on the matting, this
strangely assorted pair. A panel in the front was open,
for the night was warm, and the lamplight fell on the
veranda and the garden path beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">And they ate salted plums and crystallized prawns,
soup with seaweed in it, and rice with fish sauce, whilst
the perfume of the cherry blossoms stole in from the
night outside, and the twang of a <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> came from
somewhere in the mysterious depths of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Lotus-bud relieving her soul with music,
mournful as the sound of the wind blowing over the wet
fields of millet in the rainy weather.</p>

<p class="indent">The things having been removed, Campanula brought
forth a chess-board, which she laid on the matting before
Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">He had taught her chess, and had found her an apt
pupil, a veritable Zukertort, a female Nogi, who attacked
his positions with her ivory army, stormed his
fortifications, and put him to rout when she chose.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet he often won. She would make amazing blunders
just in time to save him from defeat, and Mac would
chuckle and say&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you are, there you are&mdash;thrown a pawn away
that might have given you back your queen in two
more moves. Never mind, you&#39;re getting on; I&#39;ll noat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
say ye aren&#39;t im&mdash;&quot; long pause&mdash;&quot;proving. Check&mdash;and
how&#39;s that for mate?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Campanula would throw her hands up in assumed
horror at her own stupidity, and Mac would
chuckle over his own supposed cleverness, and all would
be harmony and peace.</p>

<p class="indent">To-night, however, Campanula&#39;s mind was somewhat
astray, and the chess-player who lived in her brain took
advantage of the fact, and beat Mac thoroughly in the
course of a dozen moves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m getting auld,&quot; said Mac testily. &quot;Here, put
the things away. Na, na, I&#39;ll play no more the night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He lit his pipe at the tobacco-mono and moodily
smoked it. He could not bear being beaten at chess,
and now he looked as if he would be sour for the whole
evening.</p>

<p class="indent">She reached for a long-necked <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> that lay near
her on the matting, and tuned it, striking a few somber
notes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, sing us something,&quot; said Mac, and as the night
wind sighed and the cherry blossoms filled the room with
their faint, faint fragrance, Campanula, her eyes fixed
across illimitable distance, sang in a voice like the ripple
of a mountain brook, a song telling of the Miakodori,
and the sunlit slopes of Maruyama, where the great old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
Gion cherry tree blooms at the foot of Yaamis lane.
And then an old love-song strayed in from the night
and was caught by the strings of the <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> and made
articulate by her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">It told the fate of a maiden named Pine-bough, who
lived by the sea at Hamada where the foam and the sand
are as snow.</p>

<p class="indent">She loved a noble, this maiden named Pine-bough&mdash;you
can guess the rest. Mac listened, soothed; it was
the case of David and Saul over again&mdash;a very inferior
sort of Saul, it is true.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now,&quot; said the Charmed One as the rafters absorbed
the last echoes of the fate of Pine-bough, &quot;tell
us a story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula, with the <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> lying across her lap,
knitted her brows in thought. She was evidently pursuing
strange beasts across the fields of Fancy, and undetermined
as to which she would mark down and serve
up to her guest. Then she solved the matter by suddenly
clearing her brow and telling a tale without any beasts
in it at all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a garden,&quot; declared Campanula, &quot;where
every one may enter; the Mikado himself goes there,
and the riksha man, the Mousm&egrave; and the Mousko, Bo
Chan, and Kiku San. Even Campanula herself, lowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
as she is, may enter there. And there the Mousko pulls
the beard of the Emperor unafraid, and the riksha man
forgets his riksha and drinks tea at the tea houses, where
no money is paid and no money is asked for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s this garden you&#39;re telling me of?&quot; demanded
Mac, his business instincts and common sense in
arms at the latter statement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the garden of sleep,&quot; answered Campanula cunningly.
She had been waiting for the question and now
she paused, gently plucking a string of the <i>cham&egrave;cen</i>,
filling the air with a faint throbbing sound as if to
summon around her the tale-bearers of the night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here in the garden of sleep,&quot; pursued the dreamy
voice, as the vibrations died away, &quot;every tree bears a
lighted lantern swinging in the wind and painting the
grass beneath with its color&mdash;red lanterns painted with
storks, and blue lanterns pictured with the blossoms of
the cherry; lanterns on which dragons fly pursuing each
other, and lanterns disported upon by my lord the Bat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A wanderer in the garden has but to pluck a lantern
from a tree, and his dreams will at once turn in a happy
direction, and by the light of the lantern he will see
before him the object of his desire, be it what it may.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll remember that,&quot; said Mac grimly, &quot;next time
I find myself there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
&quot;One has no memory there,&quot; said Campanula, &quot;and
few people know of the secret of that place, else every
one would be happy in their dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One night entered the garden Taro San, a child no
higher than one&#39;s knee. He was the son of a tea-house
keeper, and he had plucked a glowworm from a bush,
by which feeble light he was lighting himself through
the darkness of the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All at once he found himself beneath a tree, from
the lowest branch of which swung a huge lantern of
wistaria-blue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the lantern of Spring, and the painted butterflies
upon it, by some magic, moved their wings in
flight, yet remained always in the same place, and the
painted cherry-blossoms upon it waved in some magic
wind, yet never faded or lost a petal, and the bird
upon it pursuing the dragon fly was always gaining
upon the dragon fly, yet the dragon fly, oh mystery! always
outstripped the bird.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula paused in thought, and a faintly plucked
string of the <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> filled the air with the hum of the
dragon fly&#39;s wings as it flew by reed and iris, by mere
and pond, by the unblown lotus and the blue of the
river in the country of eternal spring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Taro San,&quot; continued the story-teller, &quot;gazing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
up and beholding this fair thing, strove to reach it, and
failing, he began to weep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, there was passing by at that moment the
Daimiyo of his province, and the great lord walked with
his gaze fixed upon the ground overcome as he was by
the reverie of sleep; but hearing the sound of Taro San
weeping, he paused and asked the child what ailed
him, and hearing the trouble, he lifted him upon his
shoulder; and Taro San grasped the lantern and waved
it in the air and laughed, for its light showed him a
pleasant path beset with roses and leading to a sea, blue
as the sea of Harima, and in the path stood a little girl
plucking the amber and crimson flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Taro cried out to the Daimiyo to take him to the
little girl, but the Daimiyo did not heed, for to him
the lantern had shown Osaka Castle stormed by knights
in armor, and the spears of the Samurai all bent towards
its walls under a roof of flying arrows. Towards this
sight he ran, and Taro dropping the lantern, it went
out, and the Daimiyo awoke in his palace and Taro
awoke in the tea house upon the futon, where he slept
beside his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another night stood Taro beneath the lantern which
hung beyond his reach, but a beggar man who chanced
to pass lifting him upon his shoulder, the child seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
the lantern and waved it in the air, and instantly before
him appeared the flower-set path and the form of
the Mousm&egrave;, more beautiful now and attired in a kimono
of palest amber embroidered with silver bats.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the beggar man saw nothing but a purse of silver
lying before him on the ground, and, stooping to
pick it up, Taro fell from his shoulder, the lantern
went out, and the beggar man awoke by the roadside
where he had fallen asleep, and Taro on the futon beside
his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Many times did Taro stand beneath the lantern of
spring and many people raised him towards it, but
never one of them saw what Taro saw, all their dreams
being of things other than flowers and the time of
spring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One night,&quot; resumed Campanula after a pause,
&quot;Taro entered the garden, and beneath the lantern there
stood a child, and the child implored him to lift him
upon his shoulder, and being there the child seized the
lantern and laughed aloud with pleasure at the vision
of the roses, and the Mousm&egrave;, and the sea. But Taro
saw nothing of this. He only saw a tea house where
customers were waiting to be served, for Taro,&quot; said
Campanula, &quot;Had now grown up, and was a man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
She finished her little tale with three mournful notes
drawn from the bass string of the <i>cham&egrave;cen</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; said Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">He tapped the ashes out of his pipe into the little
receptacle of the tobacco-mono, refilled it, and lit it
with a glowing ember.</p>

<p class="indent">Whilst he was thus engaged, Campanula rose and
went to the open panel space leading on to the veranda.
He heard her addressing some one in her low, sweet
voice, then there was a pause, then she spoke again as
if in answer to some remark, then she returned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blind man,&quot; said Campanula, putting the <i>cham&egrave;cen</i>
away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I heard nobody,&quot; said Mac, looking up as he
finished lighting his pipe. &quot;What did you say? Blind
man? Was it he you were speaking to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; he said he had come from a great way, and
he looked oh, so ugly and tired! He has gone to the
back entrance, and they will give him food.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s these blessed paper houses,&quot; said Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They either swallow a sound or magnify it, so&#39;s
you can&#39;t hear yourself speak if a man sneezes in the
next room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He smoked for a while, and then rose to go.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
&quot;There!&quot; said Campanula, as she too rose. &quot;He&#39;s
gone away again down the path towards the gate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll just follow him,&quot; said Mac, &quot;and see what he&#39;s
like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He bade Campanula good night and departed.</p>

<p class="indent">The gate was closed, and there was no one on the
garden path; no one on the hill path either, he found
as he descended it slowly, peering through the gloom
before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s dom queer!&quot; muttered Mac to himself as he
reached the street. &quot;I&#39;d have staked my life she was
talking to herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He felt vaguely uneasy, and thought of returning.
Then he decided not. The path looked gloomy and mysterious
viewed from down below, and its descent without
meeting any one had already given him a slight
attack of the &quot;creeps.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="h2">THE PHILOSOPHY OF EVIL</p>

<p class="indent">Dinner was served in the Du Telles&#39; private
room. Channing dined with them&mdash;the man who
had informed Jane of Leslie&#39;s whereabouts&mdash;a young,
clean shaven man, member of the Shanghai Jockey Club
and practically head of the great silk firm of Channing,
Matheson &amp; Co.</p>

<p class="indent">At dessert Jane asked Leslie&#39;s permission to tell of
Campanula&#39;s finding. Leslie at first demurred. No one
knew anything about it except the far-away folk in
Nikko and the secretive Japanese police. It seemed
scarcely fair to Campanula to give the tale away, but
at last he consented, for George du Telle had eaten and
drunk himself into a state of torpor. He was staring at
a pineapple before him with a flushed face, from which
protruded a great cigar, and as for Channing he was
off to Shanghai next day. So Jane told the story, and
Channing listened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; said Jane when she had
finished her tale.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
&quot;I never think about these matters,&quot; said Channing,
&quot;I simply accept them. My dear lady, were you to live
a long time in the East you would come to believe in
things that Western people would rank as nursery tales.
The Tokyo fire-walkers can walk barefoot over a bed
of live charcoal as thick as a mattress. I have seen them.
How do they do it? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very curious how the Western people, Christians,
and so forth, treat the unknown. They look upon
it as the unknowable. The Easterns don&#39;t. I had a missionary
man in at my office the other day over at Shanghai
subscription hunting. I gave him what he wanted,
and then, without scarcely saying &#39;Thank you,&#39; he
asked me did I believe in God. I asked him did he believe
in the devil. He said &#39;Yes.&#39; I asked him did
he believe in devils, and he said &#39;No.&#39; I asked him did he
believe in the Bible. He said &#39;Yes.&#39; Then I recalled to
his mind the story of the Gadarene swine, and his reply
was that times are changed since then. Then I suppose,
I said, all the devils are dead? He walked away in a
huff&mdash;with my check in his pocket, though.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now the juggler man&quot;&mdash;turning to Leslie&mdash;&quot;may
have been chivied to death by devils just as the Gadarene
swine were chased into the sea&mdash;who knows?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it may have been that his madness, if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
were mad, took an acute turn, who knows? But I have
lived a good time in the East, and I am very well assured
of this, that there are men here hand in glove with
evil. I have seen things done in China, and for money
too, that could not possibly have been done by trickery,
and could not, I think, have been done by permission
of the powers of Good. I&#39;m not what you call a Christian,
and what&#39;s more, I think the Christian religion
has done a great deal of harm&mdash;not to speak of other
what you call &#39;religions&#39;&mdash;Am I wearying you, Mrs.
du Telle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in the least; please go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In this way. It has robbed us of our terror of evil.
It paints a vague devil that no man really believes in.
Now take that much-read book, &#39;The Sorrows of Satan,&#39;
where the Devil sits down and plays the piano and sings
a song.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought it was a guitar he played,&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, a guitar; it&#39;s all the same. People read that
with a grave face. He&#39;s quite a good sort and so forth.&quot;
Channing paused for a moment and gazed reflectively
at the wine in his glass, took a sip and went on: &quot;Don&#39;t
you think the thousands of people who read that stuff,
and admire it, must have lost all sense of the horrible
thing that evil is? The sense that evil is a reality, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
thing to fill us with the wildest horror if one could only
appreciate it, a very real thing, and a very determined
thing, and a thing all black; yet we get people playing
in fancy with, and even laughing about, this horror.
And writers painting the cuttle-fish center of it as a
semi-sentimental idiot capable of assuming evening
clothes and talking twaddle, or criticizing plays as he
does in Satan Montgomery&#39;s poem. We don&#39;t play with
a thing we loathe even in fancy. But we&mdash;I mean Christians&mdash;play
with the idea of the devil as if it were a
poodle dog. The truth is that Christians don&#39;t fear the
Power of Evil, they fear the Power of Good. They
praise him, propitiate and worship him in a most fulsome
manner, and say they love him. I tell you this for a
fact that no man can love good who does not abhor
evil, and you can&#39;t abhor a thing that you play with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you abhor evil, Mr. Channing?&quot; asked Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honestly, I do. Any one with eyes and the capacity
for thought who lives in China <i>must</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you must love good?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One does not &#39;love&#39; the sun, one worships it, so
to speak&mdash;but this is all very strange my talking like
this; my business in life is mainly silk and racehorses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Scuse me,&quot; said George du Telle, who was swaying
slightly in his chair, the gone-out cigar still stuck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
in the side of his mouth, his face bulged and red, and
his eye a fixity. &quot;&#39;Scuse me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, George&mdash;Well, I think, Mr. Channing,
there are worse Christians in the world than you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps there are worse men, but I don&#39;t claim to
be a Christian. Only a man who recognizes fearfully the
existence of evil as well as good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Scuse me,&quot; said George du Telle, speaking loudly
now as if he were calling a servant or railway porter.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to have this sort of thing at my table.
<i>I&#39;m</i> a Christian, brought up a Christian, die one. &#39;M
not going to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;George!&quot; said his wife in a mild voice, but a voice
very steady and full of command.</p>

<p class="indent">The Christian, who had raised himself in his chair,
subsided.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane rose from the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we go into the drawing-room and have some
music?&quot; she said. &quot;You sing, Dick&mdash;or used to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As they passed to the drawing-room she said to Channing:
&quot;Did I tell you the mark my cousin Dick made&mdash;you
know what I mean&mdash;was the Christian emblem?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear lady,&quot; said Channing, &quot;I especially dread
hurting another person&#39;s religious feelings, and I, what
am I? Just a man who thinks his own thoughts, but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if there were anything in it at all, may it not
be that the cause of the disturbance was the fact that
he touched him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have never touched the wire in connection with
a running dynamo?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Channing, &quot;for if you had you would
not be here. The metaphor is a bad one. I only mean to
say that the touch of a stick or a hand may disturb the
play of great forces with most surprising results.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE HOUSE BY NIGHT</p>

<p class="indent">It was late when Leslie left the hotel. The moon
was rising over Nagasaki, and he required no
lamp to light him up the hill path leading to the
house.</p>

<p class="indent">In the veranda he sat down to rest a moment and
pull off his boots. The landscape garden, looking very
antique in the moonlight, lay before him, the moon
lighting its tiny hills and melancholy groves with the
same particular care that presently he would bestow on
the forests of Scindia and the Himalayas. On one of
its verdurous swards lay a mark. It was the mark of
Jane du Telle&#39;s footstep imprinted on Campanula&#39;s
garden.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat for a while in thought, then he unlatched a
panel with a sort of gridiron-shaped key, then he
searched in his pocket for matches, and found he had
none.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
Determining to grope his way up and go to bed by
moonlight, he closed and fastened the panel, leaving himself
in darkness, caught his toe against an hibachi, left
as if on purpose for him to tumble over, swore, knocked
himself against a screen, which fell crash on Sweetbriar
San, the household cat, who had once made part of the
Fir-cone, Plum-blossom, Moon, and Snow ministry, and
the intelligent animal, conceiving that robbers had entered,
rushed wildly round and round in the dark till a
panel slid back revealing Pine-breeze with a wan and
weary smile on her face, and an andon or night lantern
in her hand. She handed Leslie a candle and box of
matches, and, still smiling, slid back, closing the panel
as she went, like a figure in a trick toy, Sweetbriar San
bristling and glowering on her shoulder like a fiend.</p>

<p class="indent">The upper part of the House of the Clouds was
divided by panels into a passage and three rooms. One
for Leslie, one for the Mousm&egrave;s, and the third for
Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">Pine-breeze, with her arm full of towels, or what not,
would often come into Leslie&#39;s bedroom through the wall.
He might be in his bath, he might be&mdash;anything, it was
all the same to Pine-Breeze, she was thinking of her
duties, not of him.</p>

<p class="indent">One night, long ago, he had awakened in the arms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
Mother Fir-cone, who was jibbering with fright. There
was a mosquito-net between them, for she had rushed
through the wall, and literally flung herself upon him,
tearing the mosquito-net from its attachments. I do not
wonder at her fright. Also San was in eruption, and
a fearful earthquake was roaring and billowing under
Nagasaki.</p>

<p class="indent">Several times had the Mousm&egrave;s rushed into his room
all clinging together, and crying &quot;Dorobo!&quot; (Robbers).
Robbers had tried to burgle the house twice, in
fact. He had shot one the second time, and they never
came again. Yet he always slept with a Smith and Wesson
convenient, for a Japanese robber is a business man,
without a heart, but with a desire for plunder keen as
the edge of a sword.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie&#39;s bedroom was a very bare apartment, furnished
mostly with a nothing. A futon and pile of pillows&mdash;he
had tried the makura or Japanese pillow, but given it
up in disgust&mdash;under a mosquito-net, a wash-stand, a
stick-rack, and some pegs to hang clothes on, constituted
the remainder of the furniture. The window was a wide
open space crossed by lattice slats, through which the
moon was now shining, her light partly intercepted by
the dance of a cherry bough waving in the wind.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie undressed and got into bed. Seen through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
blue gauze of a mosquito-net, the room had a character
all its own.</p>

<p class="indent">The House of the Clouds by night was not the place
for a person afflicted with insomnia. There were so
many noises only waiting to tell strange tales to the
strained ear. Tales of mystery and exaggeration. Lying
awake you would hear some one leaning close against
the attenuated house wall; it was the wind. And now,
a scratching sound as of a panther trying to commit a
burglary; it was the wind; and now a whisper like the
whisper of a lover to his mistress&mdash;or maybe of a robber
to his mate; it was the wind.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the owl sitting on the roof, staring with saucer
eyes at the moon, would give one low, whistling cry,
and his mate beyond somewhere, would make cautious
answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Then &quot;tap, tap, tap.&quot; It would be the wind&mdash;making
the skeleton finger of a dead Samurai out of a loose
lattice.</p>

<p class="indent">Then a thunder of cats and a yell on the veranda
roof, and the drowsy one, just off to goblin land with
the dead Samurai, would be brought up all standing,
and half rise for a boot, or a boot-jack, or anything
hurlable, and sink back with a sigh, remembering that
he was in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
The wind played upon the House of the Clouds just
as a maestro plays on a fiddle, but with a more distressing
result. Sometimes of an autumn or winter night
you might have sworn the place was surrounded by a
company of old Japanese ghosts escaped from the
clutches of Emma O[1] and requestful of succor and
safety.</p>

<p class="indent">[Footnote 1: The Guardian of the Buddhistic hells.]</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie could not sleep. This eruption of his past into
the present disturbed him deeply.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been getting acclimatized, losing little by
little that horrible sense of exile and home-sickness that
had driven him once across half the world to London,
and now it was all coming back.</p>

<p class="indent">And she was married to that little beast, and, worst
of all, she seemed content.</p>

<p class="indent">For eight years he had looked upon her as a thing
dead to him, and now she had returned with sevenfold
power, for she brought the past with her. The golden
past, golden despite that dour father, Colonel Leslie of
Glenbruach, that just man unacquainted with folly. She
brought the river in spate and the leaping salmon, the
heather-scented wind from the purple hills, Glenbruach
in the midst of a world of snow, the ripple of the mountain
burn and the faint reek of peat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
Worse than all these, she brought herself. She was
the same spiritually and mentally as the slim girl of
long ago&mdash;a slip of a girl straight as a wand and as
full of laughter and movement and brightness as a mountain
brook.</p>

<p class="indent">But materially she had vastly altered. She was now
a woman, divinely formed, a creature appealing to every
sensual fiber in a man&#39;s nature.</p>

<p class="indent">And George du Telle owned all this!</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie, I daresay you have perceived, was a man who
did not take what one may call a dry-light view of
things, past or present, when they had relation to himself;
as a matter of fact, he saw the shortcomings of
others tremendously clearly. The shortcomings of his
father, of Bloomfield the lawyer, of the Sydney
bar loafers, of Danjuro the curio dealer, and of
poor old sinful, grubbing M&#39;Gourley&mdash;too clearly, in
fact.</p>

<p class="indent">His own shortcomings he acknowledged by word of
mouth. He knew they were there, just as a merchant
knows a bale of damaged and unsaleable goods is in his
cellar, but he did not go down and rake them out and
examine them carefully.</p>

<p class="indent">No one ever had cared for him, he said, but he never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
asked himself if he ever had permitted any one to
care for him. With this outlook on life, a semi-poetical
nature, and passions that slept long and deeply only to
awake rejuvenated and with the strength of demons,
he might before this have gone entirely to the devil,
only for a lodger he had.</p>

<p class="indent">An old Scotch ancestor lived with him. This &quot;pairson,&quot;
who had once worn a long upper lip and had been
a writer to the signet, a just, hard, God-fearing, and
straight man, had a chamber in a convolution of Leslie&#39;s
brain, where he sat&mdash;he, or his attenuated personality&mdash;twiddling
his thumbs like a night watchman and waiting
for alarms.</p>

<p class="indent">It was this gentleman who had saved his descendant
from the weak man&#39;s form of suicide&mdash;drink.</p>

<p class="indent">He now came out in his old carpet slippers and read his
descendant a lecture on the text: &quot;Thou shalt not lust
after another man&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he spoke hard and strong, taking almost entirely
the &quot;wumman&#39;s&quot; side of the question; pointing out that
society, as we know it, imperfect as it may be, is ruled
by a number of laws whose aim is the common weal and
the individual&#39;s comfort and happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">He pointed out that the life of a &quot;wumman&quot; is composed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
not of grand passions and Italian opera scenes,
but of a hundred thousand trifles, each one insignificant
enough, yet each helping to form that grand masterpiece,
a pure woman&#39;s life.</p>

<p class="indent">That a woman might be pure in mind, even if married
to a &quot;red-headed runt&quot; like George du Telle. That
if that was so she was a happy woman, and that if a
man loved her, loved he never so madly, it would be a
strange expression of that love to blast her happiness,
and soil her soul.</p>

<p class="indent">It would not be love, but lust&mdash;the passion of those
devils which Mr. Channing had hinted at that evening,
those people of the night who slumber not nor sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Having finished, he went into his chamber and shut
the door.</p>

<p class="indent">And Leslie lay reflecting on his words, also on the
words of Channing.</p>

<p class="indent">Evil made manifest. The face of the creature on the
Nikko road came before his mental eye. That was evil
made manifest. He had seen the thing. He had known
the devil by hearsay since a child. He had heard the
&quot;Deevil&quot; thundered at from Scotch pulpits, tracts
about the devil had been put into his hand; he had heard
people make laughing remarks about him: he was so
familiar with the vague personality called Satan that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
he felt no interest in him, neither interest nor aversion.
Never a shudder.</p>

<p class="indent">But that thing in the sky of the opium dream, the
music that had brought it&mdash;that, indeed, was evil painted
by the hand of an artist; worth all the sermons ever
thundered from pulpits, all the tracts ever printed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then his weary brain grew drowsy, and there strayed
across it the fair figure of the Lost One, the very antithesis
of all things evil.</p>

<p class="indent">Only last night before going to bed she had murmured
a story half to herself, half to him, with her
eyes fixed on the glowing embers of the hibachi, and he
retold it to himself now to put himself to sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">It was about the great battle between the beasts and
the birds&mdash;the real reason why the owl was reduced to
shame and forced to cover himself with night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And they came from the North and the South and
the East and the West in flight, oh, many ri broad.
The quails from the millet, the stork from the river,
and from the pond the king-fisher, flashing like a blue
jewel in the sunlight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then said the stork, who led all these people of
the air:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Behold! we are all assembled but where tarries
Sir Owl?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
&quot;Then a sparrow made answer and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;As I paused to rest on a cherry bough, for my
wings be little though my heart is big, I heard Sir Owl
in treasonable conversation with a rat. And said he,
&quot;Come forth from thy burrow, O Rat, that I may feast
my eyes upon thee; and the empire of the beasts shall
be thine, and also the empire of the birds.&quot;&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the voice of the Hidden One replied&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But what the Hidden One made answer, Leslie did
not remember, for the artless story had lulled him to
sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="h2">MOSTLY ABOUT FLOWERS</p>

<p class="indent">O Japan! Spring! Dawn! what an exquisite and
roseate mystery surrounds the meeting of ye
three!</p>

<p class="indent">Night, and the owls, and the ghosts, have vanished,
day and the sparrows have come.</p>

<p class="indent">Up from Nagasaki rise the murmurs of life, mists
are vanishing from the hills across the harbor, where
the lateen sails of junks are rising to find the wind, and
the sampans dart about like attenuated water-beetles.</p>

<p class="indent">The far, faint sound of a bugle from the man-of-war
anchorage crosses the far, shrill crowing of a cock
owned by Mr. Pinecape, the cobbler of Jinriksha
Street&mdash;two rapiers of sound crossing each other in the
now brilliant air. Then the noises of the day deepen,
and the whirr of the cicala mixes with all sorts of faint
domestic noises, a <i>m&egrave;lange</i> from which the ear can
pick out notes just as the eye points in an impressionist&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
picture: the clatter of a pair of clogs, the call
of a watercress seller, the clash of a tin pan dropped
somewhere, and then cock-crow after cock-crow from
far and near, some loud and defiant, others defiant
enough but faint, as if coming through a pin-pole
half a mile away.</p>

<p class="indent">The kitchen of the House of the Clouds is a square
apartment, with no matting on the floor, and just now
flooded with sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie, in the early days, had caused to be constructed
by a stranded ship&#39;s carpenter, a solid English kitchen-table
of white pine. He wanted to give the man a job,
and he thought the thing would prove useful; and
it did.</p>

<p class="indent">To begin with, it smelt deliciously, and Mother Fir-cone
amidst her avocations would take a sniff at it now
and then, just as a snufftaker takes a pinch of snuff;
she would also sit under it preparing sweet potatoes,
stringing beans or what not; but as for using it as a
table, such an idea never occurred to her. In fact, she
had no ideas at all about a table, and was quite convinced
that this gift of Leslie San&#39;s was a sort of pine-wood
temple, constructed for the purpose of being sat
under.</p>

<p class="indent">It was also a place of refuge in time of earthquakes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
when the whole household, saving Leslie and Campanula,
got under it for fear of the roof falling. It received
the title of &quot;Honorable,&quot; and was altogether a thing
very much respected, and even vaguely beloved.</p>

<p class="indent">Under it this morning sat Lotus-bud, preparing fish
for breakfast; on it (these new Mousm&egrave;s used it as a
shelf) reposed various paper boxes containing eggs
and groceries, weird-looking boxes suggesting that a
conjurer was about to commence operations, not a cook.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun laid a great square of light like a burning
mat upon the floor near the table, and on her knees in
the center of this mat of light sat Pine-breeze cleaning
an hibachi. Cherry-blossom, the third Mousm&egrave;, squatted
right before Pine-breeze doing nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">From under the table was escaping a faint blue haze
of smoke. Lotus-bud had just taken a few whiffs from
a tiny pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">They all smoked, these Mousm&egrave;s, pinches of stuff
like chopped hay in pipe bowls the size of a child&#39;s
thimble; but Campanula had never acquired the art,
though all her friends were ardent tobacco lovers.
Leslie San had said &quot;No,&quot; and that was enough.</p>

<p class="indent">As Pine-breeze cleaned the hibachi and made it spick
and span, she was telling the others a yarn, mostly to
do with her doings when down the town marketing last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
evening. How she had bought this or that, what had
been said to her, and so forth&mdash;a tale simple enough,
but a miracle of genius considering the tongue in which
it was told. For in the Japanese there are but two parts
of speech, the noun and the verb; these, and splinters
and scraps of broken-up nouns and verbs, which, in the
form of particles and suffixes, help to shore up the
meaning and pin together the common sense, have to
do all the talking.</p>

<p class="indent">The learner of Japanese feels at first like a person
condemned to eat gravy soup with chop-sticks. Oh, for
even a pronoun! Imagine talking to a person without
being able to use the word &quot;You,&quot; without being able to
use the word &quot;I&quot;! Imagine the horrible tortures of a
Japanese egoist on his death-bed making, or attempting
to make, his dying speech!</p>

<p class="indent">But there are no egoists in Japan&mdash;can&#39;t be with
such a language&mdash;and there are no purse-proud snobs,
or if there are, they hide themselves very closely.</p>

<p class="indent">For self-depreciation is the key-note of Japanese conversation
and manners.</p>

<p class="indent">So she goes on with her story, in a voice sweet to
listen to as the ripple of a mountain brook, and Lotus-bud
listens under the table, fish-knife held in air, for the
tale is reaching an interesting point.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
Then Campanula&#39;s voice is heard speaking to Sweetbriar
San. She is coming to the kitchen to superintend
things and&mdash;crack! the fish&#39;s head is cut off, and three
Mousm&egrave;s are working like one.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula San is younger than any of these
Mousm&egrave;s, and she treats them like sisters, yet strangely
enough, they do not encroach, but treat her as their mistress&mdash;a
condition of things impossible in Europe, and
presently, perhaps, impossible in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun has leapt now over the hills, and Leslie is
heard moving upstairs. Pine-breeze claps her hands with
horror, and rises to her feet: she has forgotten to fill
his bath.</p>

<p class="indent">She goes to do so, and Campanula wanders out the
front way to the balcony, where she pauses to gaze at
the azaleas, shading her eyes with her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The fire is spreading; another crimson blossom is almost
unfolded, and others are soon to be born. Every
spring the coming of the azaleas is an event in Campanula&#39;s
life.</p>

<p class="indent">A wealth of crimson azaleas is one of her first recollections.
Away beyond that crimson fire of flowers lies the
land of her earliest childhood. The house with the plum
tree, very vague indeed; the father who hit things with
a hammer, still vaguer; the sugar-candy dragon lost,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
and so miraculously recovered; the little boy who went
to sleep in the snow&mdash;or was it in a field of lilies?</p>

<p class="indent">Her real life, it seemed to her, began as she was
reaching for a crimson blossom one day in a field of
crimson blossoms, and was suddenly caught up sky-high
by a thing taller than a tree, who did something
to the side of her neck, just under her left ear, that was
not hurtful or particularly unpleasant, but which,
nevertheless, made her scream.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, behold, she saw that the thing was a man,
though in strange clothes, but he did not frighten her
in the least, and she gave him her hand at once, and
with confidence, whereupon he took her in his arms and
carried her to a road where stood another man, all
black, even to his hands, but his face was white, and
he had a red beard.</p>

<p class="indent">Then this man, who was also unfrightful, began to
make her remember things that she had for the moment
forgotten. To remember her father, and the fact that
she had lost her way, and other things too, including
the errant dragon. He made her remember that she
wished to get back to her father, but she did not remember
this so very clearly. In fact she was quite content
to go with these two men over the hills and far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
away, feeling sure she was safe with them, went they
where they would.</p>

<p class="indent">The scenes on the road to Nikko she remembered: a
funny man away in the distance dancing amongst trees,
and the entry into Nikko borne sky-high above all the
other children, the Tea House of the Tortoise, and&mdash;grandest
remembrance of all!&mdash;the miraculous awakening
with the long-lost dragon in her hand. He was so
full of mystery that she never had even dreamt of eating
him, and she still possessed him. He was upstairs in
the drawer of a lacquered cabinet, cracked, it is true,
by changes of temperature and warped in the back, for
age touched all things, even sugar-candy dragons.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there was her life at the House of the Clouds,
the mission school; rainy days when she splashed
through the mud under a broad paper umbrella; fine
days when she flew kites with M&#39;Gourley San, played
hop-scotch with Kiku San and Kitsune Ken, with all
sorts of other Sans, mostly with shaved heads.</p>

<p class="indent">This was Campanula&#39;s childhood as she remembered
it. But as you cannot remember your childhood till you
have stepped over the line where the child becomes a
boy or girl, Campanula had not begun remembering
it till about six months ago.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
Up till then M&#39;Gourley San, and Leslie San, and
Sweetbriar San, and a host of other honorable people
surrounded her, one as important as the other, Mac
perhaps more important than any.</p>

<p class="indent">Then all at once&mdash;in a week or so, to be more precise&mdash;a
host of new ideas came to her, bothersome, formless
ideas, as ungraspable yet as insistent as the great Boyg
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the ideas began to take form. It was in the
garden one day. Her eyes fell on one of the flowerless
azalea bushes, and she remembered how it had been
covered with crimson flowers last year, and how beautiful
they were, beautiful above every other flower, even
the lordly peony, who seems to hold the whole glory
and mystery of summer in the gloom of his splendid
heart. And her mind wandered back from spring to
spring, led by the crimson blossoms, till she called to
mind the valley where Leslie had found her.</p>

<p class="indent">It was he who had found her wandering alone there,
and he had picked her up.</p>

<p class="indent">She had never forgotten the valley; it had lain in the
distance in her mind, but she had no use for it till now.
Now it came to her in all its splendor, and explained to
her why the azalea was the flower she loved above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
peony, the lotus, or even that glorious mystery, the
dragon-spume chrysanthemum.</p>

<p class="indent">Flowers are so bound up with the lives of the children
of Japan that they have a meaning and speak a language
to them almost unknown to us.</p>

<p class="indent">So Campanula sat immersed in her dream, and Leslie,
who had swung a hammock between two cherry trees
and was lying in it, little knew what was going on in
the small head of the person seated near him on the
square of matting. She had been doing some needlework,
but her work had dropped in her lap, her hands
were folded, and her eyes were fixed on the azalea bush.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day, or perhaps the day after, for a man&#39;s perceptions
in these matters are sometimes dull, he noticed
a change in her. He could not say what it was, but the
submissive and humble person, the very fact of whose
existence was a theme for perpetual self-excuse, had
somehow changed. She was just as submissive and humble,
but there was a subdued joyousness in her manner
when excusing her existence as though she thought
that somehow it might not be such a frightful crime
after all, and perhaps capable of condonation some day.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, when he called for his cigar-case Pine-breeze
did not appear with it, though Pine-breeze loved to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
the carrier of it, because it was a foreign thing, and the
leather smelt deliciously.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula brought it <i>and</i> a match-box, a thing that
Pine-breeze&#39;s flighty little mind nearly always forgot.</p>

<p class="indent">A few days before, Leslie had possessed three servants
and what he called an adoptive daughter. Then he suddenly
found himself in the possession of four servants,
one of them more attentive than the other three put
together. He put it down to the fact that her housewifely
instincts were awakening, and as the change in
her wrought for his comfort and ease he did not speculate
on the cause as he would have done had the reverse
been the case.</p>

<p class="indent">Women are curious creatures, as the philosophic Mac
once said. But on the whole, in their way, I think men
are just as strange.</p>

<p class="indent">Kite-flying had now been put aside with other childish
things, and the tiny hands that had grasped the
sugar-candy dragon were now preparing to grasp the
real business of life: a business whose main objective
was the happiness and comfort of &quot;He who is taller
than the tallest of trees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pine-breeze, Lotus-bud, and Cherry-blossom. Looking
at them in a row, you might have thought them
pretty much alike, as far as mind and spirit were concerned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
just as three sleek, well-groomed ponies may
seem identical&mdash;until you try to drive them.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not till Campanula took the reins that she
found the three underlings were each afflicted with a
special infirmity, or rather special infirmities.</p>

<p class="indent">Pine-breeze was such a scatterbrain that if you sent
her down town in a hurry for eggs she would, as likely
as not, dawdle home in an hour with tomatoes and some
wild tale picked up on the way, pleasant and interesting
enough, no doubt, but useless for the purpose of
making an omelette. She would leave Leslie&#39;s bath unprepared,
and then, sitting in her own tub, would clap
her hands with horror at the remembrance of her own
forgetfulness, and as likely as not attempt to rectify
her error attired in a bath towel; and she would smash
things&mdash;crockery ware understood&mdash;with almost the
facility of your Western parlor-maid. To make up for
these bad points, she was literary above her class; had
a passion for flowers above her fellows, and had composed
a poem about a grasshopper.</p>

<p class="indent">Lotus-bud was the cook; her infirmity was weakness.
She would sit and listen to Pine-breeze&#39;s idle chatter and
let the bread burn. Pine-breeze could work and talk,
but Lotus-bud could not even work and listen. So she
would sit with her hands in her lap, listening. She made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
a splendid audience but a somewhat indifferent cook.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Cherry-blossom, she was purely and simply an
idler, a lotus-eater, a hobboe in the guise of a butterfly.
A thing so fragile and pretty, so perfectly dressed
and so seemingly boneless, that you felt to expect work
from her would be absurd; which, indeed, it would have
been.</p>

<p class="indent">For she never worked, she dreamed.</p>

<p class="indent">She was enamored of a riksha man, and she would
go out and meet him under the lilacs at the gate, and
then vanish with him to goodness knows where for the
evening.</p>

<p class="indent">He was the strangest natural phenomenon, this lover

<p class="indent">At least Pine-breeze, who was an observant body, got
that far in her notation, and then gave it up as a bad
job.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
All these things, and more, Campanula had to cope
with, and she did so with more or less success, gaining
in her experience much that a girl of her age is supposed
not to know, but losing nothing either in gentleness
or modesty.</p>

<p class="indent">She brought Pine-breeze to a vague sense of the
wrongfulness of flighty ways, and with her own little
hands she made new bread to replace a batch of loaves
burnt to cinders by Lotus-bud (bread that gave Leslie
indigestion for a week).</p>

<p class="indent">As for Cherry-blossom, she told her, missionary fashion,
that she would certainly go to hell and be burnt
like Lotus-bud&#39;s loaves if she did not stop vanishing
down town with riksha men; and Cherry-blossom ground
her nose on the matting and wept, and promised reformation,
and went out two nights afterwards with No.
173 to a grand blaze up at the O Suwa temple, where
she devoured candied beans and comfits, and bowed before
graven images, and had a general good time with
a host of &quot;heathen&quot; people like herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Cherry-blossom&#39;s rikshas never cost her anything.
Love lent them to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie&#39;s socks up to this had always been vanishing,
and the ones that remained, were always, or generally,
in holes. The Mousm&egrave;s said it must be the mice. Campanula,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
however, found Pine-breeze one morning cleaning
a kettle with a silk dress-sock. It seemed silk socks
at half a guinea a pair gave a polish nothing else would
give.</p>

<p class="indent">The kettles were duller after that, but the depredations
of the mice ceased.</p>

<p class="indent">Having looked at the promise of the azaleas, she
went in to see how things were getting on.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she and Leslie were seated at breakfast
opposite to one another on the floor. Leslie, attired in
a suit of faultlessly fitting pale gray tweed, looked
much more like an Indian cavalry officer on leave than
an umbrella merchant, as he called himself. He had
arranged to call for Jane du Telle at ten o&#39;clock to take
her out shopping; the gloomy thoughts of the night
before, the effect of the opium, and the effect of the
dream, had vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">He was sipping his tea, and glancing over the <i>Japan
Mail</i>, when Campanula interrupted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What iss Dick?&quot; she suddenly asked; she prolonged
her s&#39;s in the faintest degree, difficult to reproduce
in print, for there is no type capable of representing
an s and a quarter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is what?&quot; asked Leslie, lowering the <i>Japan
Mail</i>, and staring at his pretty <i>vis-&acirc;-vis</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
&quot;Dick&mdash;she called you Dick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She who gave you the flower,&quot; said Campanula,
lowering ever so little her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which flower?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one in your coat&mdash;yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Leslie, remembering a bluebell that Jane
had plucked and given him as they went down hill the
day before, and remembering also that George du Telle
and Campanula had been walking behind and must have
seen the transaction. &quot;She calls me Dick because that
is short for my name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick,&quot; murmured she, in a meditative voice.</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed turning the name over in her mind. Tasting
it mentally, so to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is an old friend of mine,&quot; continued Leslie. &quot;I
knew her, Campanula, before you were born, away over
in another part of the world, where half the year it
snows and where the wind blows just as hard as it does
in Nippon, but the wind never brings flowers as it does
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No flowers,&quot; she murmured, incapable of imagining
such a land.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only flowers like that blue one, and wild roses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
a few others, but you never see camellia trees growing
by the roads, nor lotus flowers on the ponds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor azaleas?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor azaleas&mdash;at least, as they grow here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A shadow crossed the open doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;M&#39;Gourley San,&quot; said Campanula, who was seated
facing the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinna rise,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley. &quot;I&#39;ve had ma breakfast,
and I&#39;ll juist tak a seat on the verandy till y&#39;ve
done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m done,&quot; said Leslie, forgetful of grammar, and
rising up, he came out, the <i>Japan Mail</i> under his arm,
and a briar root in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">They talked business a while, and then Leslie said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember that woman I told you of on the
Nikko road?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which wumman?&quot; asked Mac, taking up a pebble
from the path just by the veranda, and shying it at
one of the hills of the landscape garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Girl, I meant; you remember the girl I told
you of?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh ay; the lass that flung you ower board&mdash;what
of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
&quot;She&#39;s here with her husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whaur?&quot; said Mac, turning his head as though he
fancied Jane and her spouse were camping out in the
garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s staying at the Nagasaki Hotel with her husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whoat&#39;s their names?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Du Telle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac doubled himself up for a moment, alleging for
reason a touch of the stomach-ache, as a matter of fact
it was a touch of internal laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">The day before yesterday he had found the newly-arrived
George du Telle in the smoke-room of the Nagasaki
Hotel, stood him drinks, and conducted him to
Danjuro.</p>

<p class="indent">There they had saki and pipes, and George du Telle
had bought a Pickford&#39;s van-full of rubbish, and parted
with a fat green check on Cox&#39;s. An exceedingly fat
check written with one eye shut, it is true, but quite
in order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dined with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye whoat!&quot; cried Mac, coming back from a vision
of the victorious Danjuro doing the cake-walk amidst
his bronzes and lacquers, kimono pinched up on either
side between finger and thumb, his nose in the air, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
on his face an assumption of stiff and haughty pride
enough to kill one with laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weel! weel!&quot; said Mac, addressing the hills of the
landscape garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you weel-weeling about?&quot; asked Leslie
irritably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not a puncteelious man,&quot; said Mac, still addressing
the hills, &quot;in the small concairns of life, but
if a lassie had treated me same&#39;s she you, <i>I&#39;d a seen her
dammit before I&#39;d ha&#39; dined wi&#39; her</i>.&quot; He shouted the
last words, and brought his big fist down on his knee
with a bang.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t shout,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;and make an ass of
yourself. We didn&#39;t quarrel when we parted; we parted
good friends. She didn&#39;t want to marry me&mdash;well, that
was her look-out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish they hadna&#39; come,&quot; said Mac gloomily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth is the matter with you <i>now</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve seen the waurld,&quot; said the Gloomy One, &quot;and
I&#39;ve seen wummen. And I&#39;ve seen <i>her</i>&mdash;saw her in the
smoke-room&mdash;&quot; He stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What smoke-room?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of the hotel. I was havin&#39; a crack wi&#39; her husband
day-fore yesterday, and in she come to speak a word
to him; and I know wummen&mdash;and, weel, I know, fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
between that chap with a head like a blazin&#39; whin-bush
and you, which way she&#39;ll run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t be such a fool,&quot; said Leslie,
now really annoyed and therefore keeping himself in
check; &quot;she&#39;s nothing to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac turned, and under his bushy, half-grizzled eyebrows
stared in Leslie&#39;s face, and Leslie did not support
his gaze, but turned away irritably, and flung stones
at a brown hawk that was circling in the air before them.</p>

<p class="indent">Mac got up, tapped the ashes out of his pipe, and
made off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See ye the morn?&quot; he called back as he got to the
gate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Leslie, looking at his watch and rising
to go into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">He went down at ten, and shortly after his departure,
out came Campanula, a basket in her hand and sandals
on her feet, for the weather was dry. She came along
the path towards the cherry trees, examining the ground
and the interstices of the bushes.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she saw what she wanted, a bluebell.</p>

<p class="indent">She plucked it with tender care and put it in her
basket, then she saw another and treated it the same,
and another; so went she on till it became perfectly
plain that her object was not gardening, or the gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
of a bunch of flowers, but the extermination of
every bluebell on the premises.</p>

<p class="indent">When the place had been cleared and the basket was
half full of victims, the question came how to dispose
of them. Impossible to throw them away or burn them;
she would as soon, almost, have treated children so.</p>

<p class="indent">She stood at the gate undecided, till suddenly there
came the solution of the problem, and opening the
gate she passed down the lilac-shaded path to Nagasaki.
On the way she saw more bluebells and stopped to pluck
them, so that when the lane at the bottom was reached
the basket was nearly full.</p>

<p class="indent">In a rabbit-hutch of a house off the lane lay a
tragedy, or the remains of one, in the form of O Toku
San, a poor work-girl. She had loved a man, and he
had not even betrayed her in the ordinary way. He had
simply changed his mind, and gone off with another
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">She tried to kill herself, not in the native way, but
with some abominable sort of foreign poison&mdash;Oxalic
acid, most likely; but they saved her life, and she lay
in the hospital nearly a month with her hands tied,
to prevent her trying to kill herself again.</p>

<p class="indent">When she came out of the hospital she made no more
attempts to obtain peace. She was in the clutches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
pernicious an&aelig;mia, and she now lay dying, a despairing
shadow, the ghost of what had once been a pretty
and happy girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula turned to the tiny house, and that day
O Toku San had a whole silver yen to give to her
mother on her return, and a bunch of freshly-gathered
blue flowers to charm her eye: things to the dying
better than all music and poetry, and far above the
greatest masterpieces of art.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="h2">THE STORK AND THE TORTOISE</p>

<p class="indent">They were in the street running parallel with Jinrikisha
Street, a street truly of the old time, narrow
with the house-tops, when the houses had upper
stories over-leaning the way.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane seemed fascinated by the contents of the little
shops, that sold everything from cuttle-fish to paper
lanterns. Shops that were, most of them, simply raised
platforms, matted and roofed.</p>

<p class="indent">Here abounded the tortoise-shell carvers, and the men
who can make a netsuk&egrave; to charm the eye out of anything:
a knot of wood, a shark&#39;s tooth, a useless bit of
ivory.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to buy things,&quot; said Jane, looking with
a lustful eye on the cheap, or seemingly cheap, curios
exposed for sale in some of the shops: old bronze gongs,
kettles, sword guards, broken crockery were carefully
mended, lamps, such as the Chinese magician might have
hawked at the back entrance of the palace of Aladdin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
fans, trick toys, and tiny boxes for holding rouge; tobacco-monos
and opium pipes, broken-down English
umbrellas, lacquer trays, and a heap of other dust-traps
utterly useless, and some of them not very ornamental.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you <i>will</i> waste your money,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;I&#39;d
advise you to come to Danjuro&#39;s. We can get to it by
this lane, and I won&#39;t let him swindle you beyond the
ordinary tourist pitch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; said Jane, turning from a booth bearing
this cabalistic inscription on its front, &quot;Come
rightin!&quot;[2] &quot;The things look pretty dusty, and I don&#39;t
see anything I very much want&mdash;I&#39;d like to buy <i>that</i>,
though.&quot; She pointed to a mite in the colored kimono,
playing battledore and shuttlecock in the gutter with
another mite of its own size. &quot;They seem so happy and
jolly, these Japanese children, and clean, and I read
somewhere they never give any trouble, or break things,
or annoy people&mdash;Bless the child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">[Footnote 2: I presume &quot;Come right in!&quot; was the artist&#39;s intention.]</p>

<p class="indent">A shuttlecock hit her a slap in the face, and the
shuttlecock hitter laughed, and trotted after it, without
any semblance of apology to his target.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s another illusion shattered,&quot; said Jane,
wiping her face with her handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you&mdash;&quot; began Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any children?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Jane; &quot;I have not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stork on the tortoise, emblem of eternal life, and a
&quot;supposed&quot; masterpiece of the great Miochin family
of metal-workers, still stood on guard in the fore-front
of Danjuro&#39;s wares. It was the same stork that Leslie
had seen five years ago&mdash;at least, in appearance. In
reality it had been sold five or six times during the last
five years.</p>

<p class="indent">The selling of the thing always brought forth Danjuro&#39;s
latent sense of humor, and could Danjuro the
actor have seen his namesake at these supreme moments
of trade, he would certainly have claimed him as a
brother in art.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be an American woman, perhaps, in a blue
veil, and with a smattering of knowledge picked up from
artistic books about Japan. Mac would be the go-between,
translating the desires of the female into
Japanese for the edification of Dan, who spoke
English, by the way, as well as Mac, and even, perhaps,
better.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sell it!&quot; Danjuro would cry. &quot;I would as soon
think of selling my own mother. Tell her Augustness to
ask of me anything else. It is a piece of true Miochin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
owned by my father, and his father before him. It has
always brought my family luck, etc.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All of which M&#39;Gourley would faithfully translate
with the addition:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s the greatest auld scamp in the waurld; he&#39;s
only puttin&#39; up the price. Bide a wee, and let him simmer
doon. It is not a true Miochin, but it&#39;s a vara excellent
imitation, made, mayhap, by some pupil of the Miochins.
Would y&#39; be wullin&#39; to pay twanty poonds?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Blue-veiled One assenting, Mac and Danjuro
would go for each other in Japanese, and after five minutes&#39;
ferocious wrangling, and five minutes more of interpretations,
the thing would change hands at twenty-five
pounds, to be replaced next day, or, at least, the day
after the departure of the Blue-veiled One from Nagasaki,
by its twin image. A man at Osaka made them by
the gross, and he charged two pounds ten a-piece for
them to the trade.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately, the dead know not the doings of the
living, else would the artistic Miochin family be turning
eternally in their uneasy graves, with the rapidity of
spinning bobbins.</p>

<p class="indent">Danjuro came out with his usual profound salute and
low hiss.</p>

<p class="indent">Hiss is perhaps not the proper word, for the sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
is made by the intake of air between closed teeth, and is
intended to represent delight beyond words.</p>

<p class="indent">And, indeed, when Danjuro beheld M&#39;Gourley entering
with a client ready to be shorn, the sound came from
him as no empty compliment, but as a natural expression
of his true feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">It was different as regards Leslie. Danjuro looked on
Leslie with the nervous dread with which you or I might
look upon a mischievous lunatic.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie had once nearly spoiled a bargain&mdash;a delightful
bargain from the dealer&#39;s point of view, a disgraceful
swindle viewed by the cold light of English ethics.</p>

<p class="indent">An English Member of Parliament had been trepanned
into paying two hundred pounds for a pair of vases
worth, maybe, twenty. Mac in his jubilation boasted before
Leslie, and Leslie had &quot;put the stopper on,&quot; caused
the money to be returned, with a note to the effect that
the jars were now discovered (from some documents
connected with them) to be imitation, and not as represented
when bought.</p>

<p class="indent">The Member of Parliament, instantly concluding that
<i>this</i> was a swindle, and that he had obtained priceless
articles by accident, refused to accept the money, or
return the jars.</p>

<p class="indent">And thus was he done brown on his own spit, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
basted by his own right hand, for in his book of travels,
&quot;Amongst the Japs,&quot; he mentioned the transaction, and,
worse still, sent a copy of the book to Danjuro, with the
passage marked with blue pencil.</p>

<p class="indent">Dan read the passage with the aid of a pair of horn-rimmed
spectacles, and with a face mirthless as a shovel.</p>

<p class="indent">But the soul in him bubbled. He could quite understand
the Member of Parliament&#39;s point of view, but
Leslie&#39;s was quite beyond his power to grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">Honesty for the sake of honesty, and without any
ulterior reason, even Art for Art&#39;s sake was more understandable
than that.</p>

<p class="indent">So he hissed without pleasure as he bowed before
Leslie and Jane, imploring them to condescend to
make the honorable entrance, and intimating that everything
in the place was theirs.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane nodded to him, and looked round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s one of the monstrosities I told you of that
George bought the other day,&quot; said she, pointing to a
bronze frog half as big as an ordinary coal-box. &quot;Oh,
look at <i>that</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She pointed to a furious struggle in bronze between
a man and a monster. The monster had opened its mouth
to devour the man, and the man had caught it by the
tongue, which he was tearing out.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
It was the climax of the fight, and the conclusion one
could read in the triumphant ferocity of the man&#39;s face&mdash;a
thing to make one shudder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Danjuro San,&quot; said Leslie grimly, speaking in Japanese,
whilst Jane gazed at the fighting group, &quot;this
is the lady whose husband you and M&#39;Gourley San entertained
the other day&mdash;the Red-headed One. She is a
friend of mine, and I pray you to entertain her differently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This is a vague interpretation of the Japanese for
&quot;This is the lady whose husband you swindled the other
day, but if you play any of your tricks with <i>her</i>, I&#39;ll
make you sit up&mdash;see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To fight with a Japanese you must come to blows,
for you can&#39;t possibly do it in words properly. The
old Japanese who made the language had no use
for terms of abuse: swords were good enough for
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll have that,&quot; said Jane, suddenly seizing the fat
baby, the size of a tangerine orange, done in ivory and
engaged in feeding ivory ducks on top of a lacquer cabinet,
&quot;and the ducks. Tell him to send them to the
hotel; you can fight with him about the price afterwards&mdash;and
those two vases; and oh, that ivory Mousm&egrave;
with the umbrella&mdash;isn&#39;t she sweet! I don&#39;t see anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
else I want. <i>You</i> have something, I want to make you
a present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want anything, I&#39;m tired of curios.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you&#39;ll just have to want something, for I&#39;m
going to make you a present. I&#39;ll give you this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She took up a short sword in a carved ivory scabbard.
On the ivory handle of it was figured a grimacing god,
dancing apparently. She drew the blade, polished and
razor-sharp, and then returned it to its sheath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take it; it will come in handy when those robbers
you told us of last night at dinner come again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want the thing; it&#39;s unlucky to give knives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not a knife, it&#39;s a sword!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;anything for peace;&quot; and
he took a great sheet of rice paper from Danjuro and
wrapped the thing carefully up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now,&quot; said Jane, &quot;I want something for langn-yappe,
as they say in New Orleans&mdash;something thrown
in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Danjuro declared that the whole shop was hers to do
what she liked with.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want the whole shop,&quot; said Jane, &quot;but I&#39;ll
have that.&quot; She took possession of a tiny rose tree in
the pot, a rose tree with blossoms the size of farthings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
&quot;One moment,&quot; said Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">His ear had caught a familiar sound. It came from
the cellar where many of Danjuro&#39;s goods were stowed;
it was the voice of Mac, and it came up like the voice
of the Hidden One in Campanula&#39;s story. Mac evidently
had a victim in the cellar. Leslie went to the cellar
stairs and listened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would not let him see you&#39;re wanting it. Juist
assume a casual expreesion as if ye were na so vary
carin&#39; whether ye got it or no&#39;. He&#39;ll be sure to tell ye
it&#39;s a piece o&#39; Miochin&mdash;it is <i>not</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much do you think it&#39;s worth?&quot; (A burly
English voice, suggestive of shepherd&#39;s plaid trousers,
a corporation, gold albert, and double chin.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All of fifty pounds, but not a penny more, not a
penny more. Show him the money; there&#39;s not a Jap
in Nagasaki can withstaund the sight of goud&mdash;or
notes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, if you get it for forty, I&#39;ll give you a
ten per cent. commission.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am no so very carin&#39; about commeesions; stull, as
you offer it, I&#39;ll not say &#39;No.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stork and tortoise were being sold again.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie turned away in disgust.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; he said to Jane, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot; And they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
passed out into the sunlit street, he carrying the
parcel containing the sword, she the rose tree done
up in rice paper pictured vaguely with the forms of
storks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has given him a wakizashi,&quot; murmured Danjuro,
and he retired into a corner to smoke a whiff or
two of hay-colored tobacco, and think inscrutable
thoughts, before addressing himself to the victim that
Mac was preparing down in the cellar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall we do now?&quot; asked Jane when they were
in the street.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie thought for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you,&quot; said he. &quot;We&#39;ll get rikshas and go to
the cemetery&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll do no such thing,&quot; said Jane promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you will allow me one moment&mdash;I&#39;m not proposing
to take you to a place like Kensal Green. A
Japanese cemetery is worth seeing, just as much worth
seeing as a Japanese town. Then we can go and have
luncheon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you like to go to an eel-house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gracious, no! I hate eels. First a cemetery, and
then an eel-house! I have half a mind to go back to the
hotel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
&quot;Well, a tea house, then; we can go to the Tea House
of a Thousand Joys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that quite decides the matter,&quot; said she, assuming
an outraged air, and hailing one of two rikshas that
were passing.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie hailed the other, and quietly directed the riksha
boys to the cemetery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="h2">THE SONG OF THE MUSHI</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It almost makes one wish one were dead,&quot; sighed
Jane. They were sitting on a moss-grown tussock
near a grave adorned with a fresh spray of cherry-blossom,
contained in a joint of bamboo. Beneath them
the hill stretched downwards, terrace after terrace, casting
before their eyes the cold color of marble, and the
mournful green of cryptomeria trees, the delicate tracery
of ferns, and the glory of the wild camellias. Beyond
lay the blue of the harbor, black-blue where the wooded
cliffs met the water; from the water the hills led the
eye past camphor woods and the green of the young
bamboo, up and away to where the brown of their summits
cut the dazzling azure of the sky. &quot;I have never
seen anything so beautiful, so peaceful. What are you
thinking of, Dick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was thinking,&quot; said Leslie, rousing himself, &quot;that
we might have luncheon at my place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are perfectly disgusting!&quot; said Jane. &quot;I&#39;ll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
never go to a cemetery with you again. Luncheon! Who
wants luncheon here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very few,&quot; said he grimly, gazing over the tombs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you&#39;re trying to be smart&mdash;at the expense of
these poor things. Ah! look at that tiny grave with the
white flower in the little vase.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; a thing with a great sash that was flying its
kite or spinning its top the other day, and now it&#39;s
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or hitting shuttlecocks about the street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; wiping her cheek where the shuttlecock had
hit her&mdash;then suddenly: &quot;I think men are beasts,&quot; addressing
the distant hills.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m with you there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you&#39;re not; all men are just the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you mean to infer in a roundabout way
that I&#39;m a beast. Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s nothing to be thankful for, only&mdash;they
don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took her hand in his as if to make friends, and
she let him hold it for a moment, then she suddenly drew
it away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had not we better be going? What&#39;s the time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twelve.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
&quot;Will you come and have luncheon at the hotel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thanks; why not come and lunch at my place?
I&#39;ll give you all sorts of funny Japanese things to eat.
Luncheon won&#39;t be till half-past one, but you can have
a talk with Campanula. It will only take us ten minutes
or so to get there from here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They came down to where the rikshas were waiting;
he helped her in, tucked the linen apron round her, and
gave the men their direction.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula San had not yet returned, declared Pine-breeze,
as she kow-towed before them on the matting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she won&#39;t be long,&quot; said Leslie. &quot;Shall we go
into the house or the garden?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The house,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;I&#39;m tired of the sunlight;
let&#39;s go in, and sit on the floor and talk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right. But do you mind&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, as a matter of fact, there&#39;s a clause in the
lease that no one is to go in with their boots on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, for goodness sake?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They say it spoils the matting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said Jane, holding up a small foot, and
trying to unbutton the shoe on it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me,&quot; said Leslie, going down on his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">The shoe came off, and the little foot in its bronze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
silk stocking lay in his hands for half a second&mdash;half a
second during which he was seized with a wild desire to
kiss it. Next moment it was out of his hands, and the
other was presented to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are all thumbs!&quot; said Jane. &quot;Do be quick!
I&#39;m not a stork to stand on one leg for an hour. There,
you&#39;ve burst a button off! I knew you would. Stupid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pine-breeze will sew it on,&quot; said he, hunting for the
button on his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, she won&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t in the least matter. Gracious,
Dick! when I see you just like that, crawling about
on your knees&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t help remembering&mdash;Do you remember
the rainy day at Glenbruach, when you and I were playing
marbles in the pistol gallery, and I said you cheated,
and you said you didn&#39;t, and I said you did, and you
called me a liar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you hacked my shins?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; and old Mrs. Johnstone, the housekeeper, came
in and saw me and said I was an &#39;awfu&#39; lassie!&#39; Can it
be that all that really happened, and that we are the
same people? Imagine me hacking your shins now!
Imagine us both playing marbles on the veranda!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And we didn&#39;t speak to each other for a day,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
he, following her into the house. &quot;And you looked so
stiff and sour, and all of a sudden you came up from
behind and flung your arms round my neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you shouted: &#39;Oh, get away, you little
brute!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; because I thought you were making another
attack on me, and all the time you only wanted to
k&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t. I only wanted to apologize.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, apologize, then!&quot; said he, arranging the
cushions on the floor, and placing the rose tree and the
parcel containing the sword in a corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is sad to look so far away,&quot; said she, taking as
comfortable a position as she could upon the cushions.
&quot;Life was so jolly then. Oh! a good old day&#39;s trout-fishing
is worth all the money in the world. Money is
no use; what&#39;s the good of it? It just makes one not
care for the simple pleasures of life. Do you remember
the picnic you and I and those American children, who
were staying at Callander, had, when the soda-water
bottle burst, and we found we&#39;d left everything behind
but the jam and the eggs? Dick, I&mdash;I&mdash;want to ask
you something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was one of the peculiarities of Jane&#39;s mind that a
question formulating there would work its way along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
like a worm, under, maybe, ten minutes of conversation,
and then come out at the end of a paragraph, rise for
air, so to speak, in a manner irrelevant and sometimes
startling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What became of you all those three years before
you came here to Japan?&mdash;you vanished. You
told me the other day you were in Australia; were
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was in prison.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned deathly pale, and stared at him as if he
had struck her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you need not be so alarmed; it was not a criminal
but a social prison. My father allowed me a hundred
and fifty a year, paid quarterly, as long as I lived in
Sydney, and as I had no trade and no money I lived in
Sydney for three years&mdash;tied by the leg.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you take a pleasure in frightening me; first
you told me you were a shopman, now a prisoner. Dick,
why do you <i>always</i> make your own case out worse than
it really is? Tell me, what was the last quarrel with your
father about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Debts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And, Dick&mdash;you know you used to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know I used to drink, but I don&#39;t drink now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
They were silent for a while, then he began to speak
and tell her the story of his life as a remittance man, and
he did not spare black in the composition of his picture.</p>

<p class="indent">She listened at first interested and amused by the
thought of Dick tied by the leg in Sydney, hobbled, so
to speak, and made to behave.</p>

<p class="indent">Then her amusement gave way to compassion. She
saw him wandering in the Domain, by the sea-shore, in
the streets, a lonely figure, a man with no interest in life,
an exile banned by society.</p>

<p class="indent">She thought of all the men she knew and the number
of them who were just as wicked and foolish as Dick
had ever been, yet who by keeping on the right side of
their bank balance retained their social position and the
respect of all men.</p>

<p class="indent">And thinking of all this the heart in her was moved.
A most dangerous condition just now, for Jane, Bessemer
steel in her everyday laughing mood, became wax
when her compassion was aroused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you write and tell me?&quot; said she. &quot;I&#39;d
have gone and seen your father. Oh, it was wicked to
send you off like that, away from every one. <i>How</i> could
a father treat his child so!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were silent again for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Dick!&quot; said Jane suddenly, and she took his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
hand in both hers and stroked it. A little shiver went
through him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, all at once, she felt an arm around her waist
and his breath upon her cheek, and she did not try to
take her hand from his or struggle, nor, after the first
second of troubled alarm, did she feel the wish to
struggle.</p>

<p class="indent">She had ceased for the moment to be Jane du Telle,
a married woman, a person with a stainless reputation.
All these facts were swept away by nature, just as shrubs
and fir trees are swept away by the rush of the avalanche.</p>

<p class="indent">A great faintness came over her. She clung to him,
and sinking backwards, fell upon the matting; his arms
were around her, his breath on her cheek, her lips were
returning his kisses, yet all the time her lips were murmuring:
&quot;Don&#39;t&mdash;don&#39;t&mdash;don&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">At this supreme moment came a sound strangely alien
to the situation&mdash;the jingling of tea-cups no less&mdash;and
through the wall, or at least the opening of a panel,
entered Pine-breeze, followed by Cherry-blossom, with
the luncheon.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick!&quot; she cried, sitting up with her cheeks raging
red, &quot;tell them to go away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
But Dick was not heeding her. He was sitting up
with his hands to the side of his head, and an expression
on his face that made her almost forget her own position
before the Mousm&egrave;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you hear it?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That noise, my God, that noise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A tiny cage was hanging from a hook on the wall. In
it was a thing much beloved by Campanula&mdash;an insect
like a grasshopper that sang a buzzing and tremulous
sort of song. The mushi was a creature that only sang
by night as a rule, but some spirit had moved its poetic
soul, for it was singing now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s that thing in the cage,&quot; said Jane, pointing to
it tremulously, thankful for any excuse to escape the
glances of the Mousm&egrave;s.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up, sprang to his feet, went to the cage,
and tore it from its hook.</p>

<p class="indent">The Mousm&egrave;s screamed out, for from his furious manner
and the expression of his face they felt he was about
to dash cage and mushi on the matting, and trample
them underfoot.</p>

<p class="indent">And he was, for one horrible moment. Then something
in him prevailed&mdash;the something that had made
him pick the Lost One up and kiss her, and carry her all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
the way to Nikko; the spirit of good that had made him
always not so bad as he might have been.</p>

<p class="indent">He rehung the little cage on the hook, and the thing
in it became dumb; the sound in his head that troubled
him had died away, and he returned to where Jane was
sitting, and resumed his position on the cushions near
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he told the Mousm&egrave;s to leave what they
had brought on the floor, and to go away till he called
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Jane, when they were alone again, &quot;to
think they should have seen me like that. Oh, <i>Dick</i>!
How could we&mdash;how could I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>They</i> don&#39;t matter,&quot; said he gloomily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t <i>talk</i> to me!&quot; She wrung her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For goodness sake,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;don&#39;t make mountains
out of molehills. They saw me kiss you, well, what
of that? and they don&#39;t talk English&mdash;at least, English
that any one can understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But like that on the floor,&quot; murmured Jane, comforted
somewhat by the last statement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what of that? We are in Japan, where people
live on the floor. I admit if a servant in England came in
and saw&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Don&#39;t!</i>&quot; screamed she; &quot;don&#39;t speak about it again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
It was a moment of weakness; let us forget forget it.
I mean, let us <i>remember</i> it as a warning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you feel like eating luncheon?&quot; he asked, looking
at the pathetic little dishes and tea-cups, each on its
sea-green mat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I feel like nothing. I only want to go and bury
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He poured her out some tea and took some himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You frightened me,&quot; she said in a tremulous voice
after they had sat for a moment in silence. &quot;I thought
you were going to do something dreadful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you took that cage down with the buzzing
thing in it that annoyed you&mdash;poor atom!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It didn&#39;t annoy me; that was not the sound I heard.
It was the sound I heard in the dream I told you of&mdash;that
devil&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A figure stood in the doorway: it was Campanula returned.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="h2">M&#39;GOURLEY&#39;S LOVE AFFAIR</p>

<p class="indent">Mac had gone down to the office that morning in a
temper.</p>

<p class="indent">The staff consisted of himself and Ah Hop Sing, the
Chinese office boy. He could not quarrel with himself,
so he quarreled with Ah Hop Sing, using a rattan cane
to enforce the argument, till Ah Hop Sing hopped and
sang in a fashion that justified his title.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Mac wrote business letters and whilst he wrote,
the thoughts of this dusty and unlovable-looking Scot
went far astray on pleasant and picturesque roads, under
blue skies, by brakes all gay with the crimson japonica
flowers and the glorious beauty of the red camellias, and
beneath the solemn darkness of the cryptomeria woods
of Nikko.</p>

<p class="indent">That is to say, they would stray to these places, and
then he would recall them to indite letters of advice to
Maconochie of Glasgow, a letter of abuse to Mr. Oyama&mdash;a
gentleman who never fulfilled his contracts when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
they threatened loss, sheltering his business self behind
the ample kimono of the Tokyo guild&mdash;and letters to
divers other people in trade.</p>

<p class="indent">And still his thoughts would stray whilst he gummed
and stamped the envelopes, and they would be buying
dolls now at booths in Jinrikisha Street, or helping to
fly kites at the House of the Clouds.</p>

<p class="indent">They would stand watching a small person playing
kitsune-ken with another person of her own age; and the
same small person laboring up the Hill to the House of
the Clouds, burdened with a bundle of books, and
sheltered beneath a many-ribbed crimson umbrella.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they would glance at the same person, bigger
grown, and suddenly become beautiful; then they would
heave their shoulders and sigh, and all come back to help
in the addressing of a letter to M&#39;Clintock of Osaka, or
some other magnate of the Jap Rubbish Trade.</p>

<p class="indent">Mac was in love, as I have before indicated: in love
with three people. A tiny dot in a blue kimono and stiff
sash; a person somewhat similarly dressed, whom he had
sometimes helped of evenings with her lessons, or watched
as she pricked her fingers over needlework; and a
Mousm&egrave; as pretty as seven.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been in love for years without knowing it; a
flower had been growing in this dusty soil, where one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
could not fancy any green thing finding nutriment,
unless, perhaps, a weed. A white flower, pure and without
stain.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing could be more ideal than this love, nothing
with legs and arms attached to it could be more un-ideal
than Mac. And the strange thing was that this pure
blossom of the soul did not improve the soul it grew from
a bit, at least as far as human eye could see, for the man
of the Great Tung Jade and the Lessar papers incidents
was, morally, just the same&mdash;worse, if anything&mdash;as
the wailing clients of Danjuro could testify.</p>

<p class="indent">When Campanula was alone with Leslie in these later
days, she wore a grave and thoughtful air. Watching
her, one could perceive that he alone possessed her mind;
all the quaint and charming ways of her childhood, all
things frivolous and light, she seemed to have dropped
and left behind her with her toys.</p>

<p class="indent">When Campanula was quite alone with M&#39;Gourley, a
subtle change came over her. The child came out and
played.</p>

<p class="indent">Though Leslie had adopted her as a daughter, she
had by no means adopted him as a father.</p>

<p class="indent">Tod M&#39;Gourley was her adoptive father, or, at least,
she treated him as such. He acted also as uncle, aunt,
grandmother, brother and general playmate all combined;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
and any half-holiday during the last few years,
you might have seen Campanula and her family strolling
along Jinrikisha Street, or on the Bund: the family
in an old top hat, black broadcloth suit, and bearing a
gamp umbrella in its hard fist.</p>

<p class="indent">They would stray together through the wonders of
the town, Mac and she, and pause and gaze in at shops
like two children, buy sweets and eat them unashamed
and openly. Stop to look at performing monkeys, or
listen to street ballad-singers, or criticize passing funerals.</p>

<p class="indent">He had never seen so much of life round town as
Campanula showed him, clapping beside him in her little
clogs when the streets were damp, or gliding beside him
sandal-shod in the warm, dry days of spring.</p>

<p class="indent">Where Campanula was concerned, this dour and dusty
Scot had all the delicate and instinctive feelings of a
woman; he had noticed &quot;fine&quot; the change that had come
over her of late, and the change in her manner towards
Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">The thing pleased him, yet it made him sigh&mdash;and
frown, when he called to mind &quot;that wumman,&quot; the
mental label he had attached to Jane du Telle.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had finished business he went to Danjuro&#39;s
shop, where he had an appointment, as we have seen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
with an Englishman. The Englishman having been duly
plundered, Mac looked at his watch, found it was nearly
twelve, and was struck by a bright idea.</p>

<p class="indent">He would go to the House of the Clouds, fetch
Campanula out, and have luncheon with her.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes later found him on the veranda.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula had just returned, having left O Toku
San.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley sat down on the veranda, and Campanula
sat down beside him on a little fur rug made from the
skin of an Ounce, or some such small animal. She looked
sad and depressed, and her eyes wandered about the landscape
garden as if questioning its hills, its streams, its
old, old forests.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Campanula,&quot; said Mac, taking her little hand
between his great rough, red paws, &quot;what ails you,
child? You look sad and fashed, what&#39;s been worrying
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been to see O Toku San,&quot; replied Campanula,
speaking in Japanese. &quot;She is dying. Her heart is
dead,&quot; said Campanula, putting her other little hand
over her own heart. &quot;I am&mdash;oh, so sad! for to-day the
thought of death has come to me, a thought that I never
knew before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Child, child,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, &quot;dinna speak like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
that. We must all die soon or later&mdash;ay, ay, we must all
die, sure enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But not so sadly as she,&quot; replied Campanula with
a little sob.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley looked at her; she was in tears.</p>

<p class="indent">He drew her close to him just as a mother might have
done, and held her to him whilst she rested her head
against his old coat, and sobbed and wept like a little
child, gazing at the landscape garden through the veil
of her tears.</p>

<p class="indent">He rocked her gently to soothe her, but said nothing,
holding her just as he had held her that day in the
gardens of Dai Nichi Do, as if to protect her against
Death, as he had that day protected her against the
vision of the terrible Akudogi.</p>

<p class="indent">Her sobs slowly ceased, but still she kept her cheek
rested against his coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is Death?&quot; she suddenly asked. The question
was quite beyond M&#39;Gourley.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinna ask me,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s what we all must
come to some day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And will O Toku San see him she loved when she
goes&mdash;there?&quot; continued she, as if unheeding his reply.
&quot;Perhaps&quot;&mdash;after a long pause&mdash;&quot;he will know her
love for him when he too is there, and make her happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;Mayhap,&quot; said M&#39;Gourley, who did not know the
facts of the case, or perhaps he would not have taken so
cheerful a view of O Toku San&#39;s lover&#39;s future state.
&quot;Mayhap.&quot; He looked down at her little face. Her
eyes were dry, but a tear was still wet on her cheek. He
took out his handkerchief and dried it.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula smiled faintly, pressed her cheek ever so
slightly against his arm as if in thanks, and drew away
from him, resuming her position on the little rug.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley took out his pipe, lit it, and began to
smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;just put on those sandal shoes of
yours again, for I am going to take you out with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot; asked Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No matter where,&quot; replied Mac, rising from the
veranda. &quot;A nice place where you and I&#39;ll go&mdash;you
and I together, as we did along the Nikko road, only not
on my shoulder. Na, na! you&#39;re ower big for that. Do
you remember the sugar-candy dragon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! the Hon. Dragon!&quot; replied she in the vernacular,
as she bent to pass the sandal-strap past the great
toe of her white tabi. &quot;He is upstairs with&mdash;other
things, but the Hon. Dragon is very old now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she took her umbrella and opened it, and
M&#39;Gourley and she passed down the path to the gate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
He held the gate open for her, and she passed through
with a murmured word of thanks, and then she led the
way down hill under the perfumed beauty of the lilac
boughs.</p>

<p class="indent">About half-way down, Campanula stepped aside as if
to let some one pass. M&#39;Gourley, close on her heels, and
in a reverie, did the same thing unconsciously. If someone
had passed, that someone must have effaced himself
amidst the lilac trees on the left of the path.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor blind man!&quot; said Campanula, looking back
up the path.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whoat?&quot; cried Mac. &quot;Whoat did y&#39; say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blind man,&quot; replied Campanula; &quot;he who came last
night&mdash;you remember!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley took off his old top hat, and drew his coat
sleeve across his forehead. Beads of sweat had sprung
there all of a sudden.</p>

<p class="indent">He stood for a second or two looking at Campanula,
and then for a second or two looking up the path,
pied with sunshine and shadow, the pretty path that
for him had suddenly been made horrible. There
was nothing to be seen, nothing but the sunshine and
shadow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My eyes are growing auld,&quot; he said at length. &quot;Do
you see him still, Campanula?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
She had turned away to look at a fern that was growing
on the bank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not see him now,&quot; she replied. &quot;He has gone
through the gate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure,&quot; said Mac, speaking in a subdued
voice, &quot;that he was the same man that came last
night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula was quite sure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait for me,&quot; said Mac, &quot;and I&#39;ll run up and tell
them to give him some food.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He came hurriedly back up the path, very much
against his will.</p>

<p class="indent">There was nobody in front of the house, he went
round to the kitchen. The Mousm&egrave;s were there, preparing
luncheon&mdash;at least, preparing to prepare it in a
leisurely way.</p>

<p class="indent">Had they seen anyone about the house, a blind
man?</p>

<p class="indent">No, they had seen nobody, only the poulterer, who had
been with eggs an hour ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Had they seen a blind man last night&mdash;had a blind
man called round at the kitchen to ask for food?</p>

<p class="indent">No; nobody had been for food to the kitchen last
night, least of all a blind man.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Mac hurried off, and the Mousm&egrave;s dropped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
everything to discuss the meaning of all these questions
asked by the Learned One; and Pine-breeze embarked on
a story about two blind men and a frog, and the fox-faced
representative of the rice god, a story that put
the luncheon back half an hour.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula was plucking flowers when Mac returned.
Just three or four with a delicate fern frond, such a
charming little bouquet, a veritable work of art made in
a moment with unerring taste and a few turns of her
deft fingers. She made Mac bend, and fixed the tiny
bouquet in his coat-lapel.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they pursued their way, Mac vastly perturbed
in his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">There was just now living in the pleasant city of
Nagasaki an inn-keeper of the name of Yamagata, who
owned a tea house named &quot;The Full-blown Peony
Flower.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Yamagata was a Progressive. He believed that a
tea house where a real English luncheon or dinner could
be obtained would, judging from his compatriots&#39; passion
for things European, be a success.</p>

<p class="indent">And it was, till half Jinrikisha Street nearly died of
indigestion.</p>

<p class="indent">His tea house was a tiny affair situated up an entry
near Danjuro&#39;s shop, and surrounded by a little courtyard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
wherein grew dyspeptic-looking plum trees in pale
amber-colored pots.</p>

<p class="indent">Danjuro, who was a friend of Yamagata&#39;s, had been
chanting the praises of the place so long, that Mac had
become obsessed by the idea of it; and casting about for
somewhere new to take Campanula, the idea had turned
up like a horrible sort of trump card.</p>

<p class="indent">The tea house was on its last legs, and practically deserted,
so they had the place to themselves; and having
ordered the meal they sat on the matting of a desolate
room and waited for it to come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Campanula,&quot; said Mac, &quot;you have never seen that
blind man before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never; nor one so ugly as he.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Campanula,&quot; said Mac earnestly, &quot;if you see him
again dinna speak with him; he&#39;s an ill man and bodes
no good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, indeed, she did not wish to speak with him, but he
was so old and poor and ugly she could not but feel sorrow
for him; and he said last night that he had come
such a long way off, and must soon return.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley shuddered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay,&quot; said he to himself, &quot;a dom long way off;&quot;
then to Campanula: &quot;Said he anything else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;No,&quot; replied Campanula, &quot;for I told him to go to
the back entrance, and he went.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the soup was brought in by three
somewhat faded-looking Mousm&egrave;s, each armed with a
plate, a real English soup plate.</p>

<p class="indent">The soup was thin and not exuberantly hot, but it
seemed vastly to amuse Campanula when it was put before
her. &quot;A,&quot; said she, pointing with her spoon-tip to
something at the bottom of the plate, &quot;B&mdash;C&quot;&mdash;she
was pointing to the little Italian paste letters floating, or
rather sunk, in the mixture. &quot;D&mdash;and look&mdash;a cow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mac looked over to admire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, ay, it&#39;s a coo, right enough, an&#39; there&#39;s a cock
and hen; but eat it up before it gets cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula ate her alphabet, and the next course appeared.
A boot sole labeled a beef-steak, which vanished,
uneaten, and was replaced by what seemed to be an old
stone cannon-ball, such as they used to fire out of Mons
Meg. The O.S.C.B. was labeled a pudding.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the caricature of an ordinary English middle-class
country luncheon.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was an amazingly clever caricature: a perfect
work of art.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon, M&#39;Gourley returned to business, and
Campanula to the House of the Clouds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE COMPLETE GEOGRAPHER</p>

<p class="indent">On the way, she stopped at the shop of Mr. Initogo
to pay a visit to her friend Kiku.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula in her school-days had shown both qualities
and defects of mind. At languages, at least in learning
the English language, she was a success; a very
moderate success where mathematics were concerned,
though she knew enough to do long division, and to keep
household accounts. They teach a lot of useful things at
the mission schools&mdash;needlework, and so forth, and in
some of these branches Campanula shone, but at geography
she was a dismal failure. She had been always
lacking in the power of location. Witness her first statements
as to the whereabouts of the house with the plum
tree in front of it.</p>

<p class="indent">The long sea voyage from Tokyo, or rather from
Yokohama, had brought into her mind the impression
that she had traveled to the end of things, yet they told
her there were things beyond.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
They showed her maps and globes. The maps were
flat, and the globes were round, yet they said they were
the same thing, or were pictures of the same thing. How
a flat thing could be round or the converse, she could not
say, but Howard San, the missionary, said they were.
Was it for her to contradict him? So, instead of setting
up her own wits against Howard San, and questioning
him, she accepted his words just as you or I accept the
words of mathematicians or physiologists concerning
subjects on which we are ignorant. And thus on geography
she got hopelessly muddled, and remained so.</p>

<p class="indent">This morning she was lamenting her want of geography,
and casting about for some friend learned in the
art. Of course she might have gone to Howard San,
but she would have to wait till school was over, and, besides
she felt a certain diffidence in approaching him on
the subject, so she turned to the shop of Mr. Initogo.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Initogo was sitting on his heels on the floor of
his shop, engaged in the gentle art of making tea; it
was one of his fads that he always made his own tea with
his own hands. Beside him stood an hibachi, on which
a kettle was coming to the boil; before him, a tea-cup
without a handle on a tray, and a microscopic tea-pot.</p>

<p class="indent">He warmed the tea-cup with a few drops of hot water;
then, from a cylindrical tea-canister, with a thing like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
a snuff-scoop, he took a small quantity of green tea&mdash;tea
of the color that an old black coat turns after years
of sun and rain&mdash;this he popped into the tea-pot.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the honorable hot water being ready, he poured
it into a porcelain dish to let it cool slightly, which it
did, becoming converted during the act into the honorable
old hot water.</p>

<p class="indent">The honorable old hot water being now ready, he
poured it into the tea-pot, popped on the lid, looked up,
and saw Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">So immersed in his darling employment had he been,
that he had not observed her entrance.</p>

<p class="indent">She wished to see Kiku? She was upstairs; this with
a thousand apologies for his own blindness, and comparisons
of himself with worms and other sightless
things.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula knew the way up; she had been up often
enough before, and up she went.</p>

<p class="indent">Kiku San, since we hinted at her as a playmate of
Campanula, had grown. The tumbling tot that Leslie
had once caught by the &quot;scruff&quot; of her obi and held
out at arm&#39;s length wriggling, for the amusement of
M&#39;Gourley, had become a Mousm&egrave; with a face at once
heavy and flighty-looking; a broad face, pretty enough,
but with a maddeningly irresponsible expression.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
Pine-breeze was bad enough in the irresponsible line,
but she could have learnt much from Kiku.</p>

<p class="indent">She was the dunce, or, rather, had been the dunce at
the mission school; this is not saying very much against
her, for Japanese girls are amazingly quick in the &quot;uptake,&quot;
learning coming to them as easily as ignorance
to English girls; all the same she had been the dunce.
She had never been able to conquer the letter &quot;l&quot; in
English; and would say &quot;raidy&quot; for &quot;lady;&quot; yet she
had a memory of sorts, blocks of facts swam in the ocean
of her unintelligence like those houses that float about
after an inundation of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class="indent">But the place left vacant in her skull by want of
learning was by no means devoid of a tenant; therein
dwelt a colossal impudence, a supreme self-assurance
that sheltered and helped to hide the nakedness
of her mind, and even obtained for her, amongst her
girl friends, a sort of fungoid reputation for cleverness.</p>

<p class="indent">For when Kiku San said a thing, she said it with such
assurance that it seemed true&mdash;the assurance of the absolutely
untrustworthy intellect, which of all assurances
is the greatest.</p>

<p class="indent">She was sitting now on her heels in a bare room on the
upper floor, a tobacco-mono at her side, and in her hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
a round flat box with a glass lid. She was playing at
Pigs-in-Clover.</p>

<p class="indent">The two Mousm&egrave;s bowed to one another with great
ceremony, enquiring after each other&#39;s honorific health,
and then Campanula came to rest upon the matting opposite
to her friend.</p>

<p class="indent">They formed a pretty picture in the bare room with its
chess-board matting, against the bare walls, whose only
ornament was a kakemono representing Fuji San crested
with snow.</p>

<p class="indent">Kiku was soon to be married&mdash;married to a government
clerk to whom she had been engaged nearly since
birth; and she entertained Campanula with long and
uninteresting descriptions of her husband-to-be, his
mother, his father, his grandfather, who lived at Nagoya,
his brothers and sisters, how old they were and all about them.</p>

<p class="indent">Kiku was a bore, a female bore of the first water, and
in this respect she could have given any old member
of the Rag or Carlton points, and beaten him.</p>

<p class="indent">She told all these things looking up from under her
thick eyelids, and with a half-smile, and Campanula listened,
half mesmerized, wholly weary, but with all her
courteous soul awake to do honor to the tale.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
At last an hiatus occurred of which Campanula took
advantage to ask the question in her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Did Kiku, so learned on all subjects, know of any
land where the snow lay for half the year?</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, certainly Kiku did, and she told about it.</p>

<p class="indent">Describing her future husband and his relations she
had been vague and uninteresting, lacking, as she did,
the gifts of perception and narration. But now, plunging
into the empire of pure lies, she spoke with an assurance
that made her words sound like gospel.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a country existed; as a matter of fact, she had
it all in a book somewhere, but she did not need the
book, as she never forgot anything. It lay in the sea beyond
Nankin two hundred and sixty-seven ri beyond, and
the snow lay there half a year, sometimes more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it a country where blue flowers grow, and roses&mdash;sometimes?&quot;
said Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just so, sometimes;&quot; and Kiku, searching in the
capacious bag of her ignorance, began to produce old
broken-up facts that had been lying there like rubbish
in the basket of a chiffonier.</p>

<p class="indent">The sea all round that place was frozen most of the
year, and the sun shone once a month or so.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she painted a graphic picture of this desolate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
land which she declared to be divided into four parts,
Unster, Munster, Rinster and Comit; and Campanula
sat listening and receiving it all as truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Liars, somehow, are always sure of an audience; you
and I, who speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, languish in conversation and are not
heard, whilst your mendacity-monger holds the floor and
absorbs the interest.</p>

<p class="indent">So Kiku San went on spinning her tale, and Campanula
San sat opposite to her and listened, shivering
at the dismal pictures being raised before her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, all at once, from below came the irate voice of
Mr. Initogo calling Kiku the &quot;Heedless One.&quot; If he
could have used a stronger expression he would have used
it, for the dinner ought to be cooking at this moment,
and the fish and seaweed had not arrived. The Heedless
One had been, as a matter of fact, playing at Pigs-in-Clover
all the morning instead of marketing.</p>

<p class="indent">The Complete Geographer rose to her feet in a hurry,
for filial obedience resided in her breast, not so much
as a virtue, but rather as a sort of mainspring put in
by nature&mdash;or rather, I should say, heredity.</p>

<p class="indent">They went out together, and Kiku bought the fish
and the seaweed and a few other important items, and
then they parted, Kiku returned home laden with marketings,
and Campanula to the House of the Clouds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE STRUGGLE</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie walked back to the hotel that day with Jane.
When he left her he was vastly troubled in his
mind. Troubled about Jane, troubled about Campanula,
troubled about himself, and troubled about a vast, vague,
tragic something: a shadow stealing up from his past
and already tingeing his future with the twilight that
comes before eclipse.</p>

<p class="indent">What demon had called Jane up from the past?</p>

<p class="indent">Unconsciously during the last five years he had been
altering for the better. The friendliness and kindness
of Japan, the frank friendliness of M&#39;Gourley, that most
unconscionable Scot, the beauty of the flowers and seasons,
and Campanula&mdash;above all, Campanula&mdash;these
things had worked upon him with slow but sure effect.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly, he had learnt the great, great secret that happiness
is to be found, not in grand palaces, not in wealth,
not in success, but amongst the lowly and little things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
of life, the things that no man can appreciate who has
not a free and untroubled conscience.</p>

<p class="indent">The new book, the pipe of tobacco smoked beneath
the cherry trees of a morning, the home-coming of Campanula
from school of an evening laden with books and
perplexities, the rubber of whist with Mr. Initogo, the
quaint, funny things that are always happening in a
Japanese household&mdash;these and a thousand other trifles
had made up the sum of his life, and the addition of
them made happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">And Campanula&mdash;he little knew how much she had entered
into his being&mdash;what a multitude of impalpable
threads bound her to him, threads that had been spinning
from the very first day, when he found her lost
amidst the crimson azaleas!</p>

<p class="indent">He had eaten the lotus for nearly five years; he had
been preparing a future of happiness and peace, and
who knows what boundless possibilities of love?</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, Satan had appeared before him with the
command, &quot;Get up and fight, fight me for this future
you have been preparing for yourself; fight me for the
beauty of it, the happiness you will have in it, the happiness
you will make for others in it; get it if you can, for
my weapon is Lust.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That night, when the moon, now waxing stronger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
laid her patient square of pure white light on the floor
of his room, the battle began in earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">He had determined on going to Arita on the morrow
to get away for a while from the woman against whom
he felt fate was driving him with ruinous intent.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, as he lay alone, with the powers of good and
evil on either side of him, he reviewed his position clearly
for the first time.</p>

<p class="indent">The cold, calculating, sneaking, pickpocket form of
adultery, which is the canker at the heart of English
society&mdash;to put it in plain English, the bestial use of
another man&#39;s wife behind his back&mdash;was a form of
crime as unthinkable to Leslie as the crime of cheating
at cards, or forging a check.</p>

<p class="indent">To obtain the woman he wanted, there was only one
way. The open way.</p>

<p class="indent">That meant the smashing up of everything around
him. He must leave Japan, leave Campanula, for, deep
in his heart, something told him that Campanula could
have no place in that new life. It meant the social ruin
of Jane du Telle.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, alone, away from the object of his passion, all
this was very clear.</p>

<p class="indent">Then that same old Scotch ancester, with the long
upper lip, and the crude common sense, and the rigid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
belief in God and the law, came out of his cell and spoke
to this effect. There is no excuse before God or man for
adultery. Love, the child of God, has no part therein,
but Lust, the child of the devil, and the end of Lust is
Hell.</p>

<p class="indent">All this, with the thoughts that went before it, was
edifying and made for good, and the devil said nothing,
for the devil, like the great Boyg, has a method with
some natures. He does not strike, but lets the victim
do the striking, hedging him gently, gently, letting him
hit out widely till he is exhausted, or beats himself to
death as the Blind One beat himself against the trees.</p>

<p class="indent">Early in the morning Leslie rose, white and haggard,
and dressed, and went off to the station without waiting
for breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell Campanula San I am going to Arita on business,
but will be back to-night. Tell her I am going
alone,&quot; he said to Pine-breeze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kashko marimashta,&quot; murmured Pine-breeze, in a
voice of devotion, and he departed.</p>

<p class="indent">He was going to Arita to get beyond the reach of
Jane, and lo! when he got into the railway carriage, she
was there&mdash;not in the flesh, but in the spirit. And when
he alighted at Arita, she was on the platform, and in the
street she walked at his side.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
The tones of her voice thrilled him, and he smelt the
perfume of her hair, he felt the curve of her waist,
and his lips felt the satin of her throat, but the physical
desire was small compared with the terrible sentiment
that was born of it, the heart-breaking longing inspired
by her idealized image.</p>

<p class="indent">Passion, when it rises to this dimension in the mind
of a man, has beautiful attributes as well as vile, it
holds in its hands pictures of perfect innocence, besides
the others.</p>

<p class="indent">The devil takes care of that!</p>

<p class="indent">He saw Jane not only as she was, but as she had been,
fair, and fresh, and innocent, against the background of
the beeches round Glenbruach, and the sea lochs, and
the purple hills.</p>

<p class="indent">What he did with his body that day in Arita, or where
he wandered, he could never tell, for his mind was fighting
a battle so fierce that all intelligent perception of
outward things was blurred.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of it he found himself in a tea house sitting
before some food which he had apparently ordered, and
the battle was won. So he told himself.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, he was worn out. Passion was
exhausted, fighting against fate, attempting to escape
from the pursuing devils, beating himself against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
trees, he had fallen beneath them, telling himself that
the battle was won, wondering at himself that he ever
could have even dreamed of the ruinous course of action
which lust had urged him to.</p>

<p class="indent">But the trees remained steadfast and unharmed, waiting
only for the renewal of the madman&#39;s strength and
the inevitable end.</p>

<p class="indent">It was dark when he reached the Nagasaki station. He
picked a riksha from a row of them standing outside
with hoods up, for it had been raining slightly, and
looking absurdly like a row of tiny, unhorsed hansom
cabs, and told the man to take him to the House of the
Clouds.</p>

<p class="indent">He came up the hill-path, and as he came the wind,
blowing against him, brought a perfume with it, the
perfume of rain-wet azaleas. During the day and the
previous night dozens of blossoms had broken forth,
filling the garden with their fragrance and beauty;
dozens more would be born ere the morrow under
the light of the silvery moon now gliding up
over the hill-tops behind a tracery of flying, fleecy
clouds.</p>

<p class="indent">As he approached the house, he saw through the open
panel space the silhouettes of Pine-breeze and Cherry-blossom.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
They were sitting opposite to each other on their heels
upon the lamplit matting, and seemed at first to be engaged
in the game of kitsune-ken, but almost instantly
he perceived that they were playing at no game, but
were engaged in conversation. Alarmed conversation, to
judge by the movements of their hands, now up-flung,
now flung out sideways. Sweetbriar San was promenading
the matting with tail fluffed out, now rubbing against
Pine-breeze, now against Cherry-blossom, attempting apparently
to join in the conversation, and seeming to
share in the excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">Something had happened of a tragic nature&mdash;but
what? Two steps brought him on to the veranda two
more into the house with his boots on, despite the clause
in the lease.</p>

<p class="indent">The Mousm&egrave;s gave two little shrieks, wheeled round,
and kow-towed before the August One.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter?&quot; he asked. &quot;Has anything
happened? Is Campanula San safe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula San was quite safe.</p>

<p class="indent">Then why all this? What had they been conversing
about with so many exclamations?</p>

<p class="indent">Confused replies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go,&quot; he said, &quot;and bring me some tea, and ask
Lotus-bud to come hither.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
In a few moments Lotus-bud, wearing a very white
face, appeared, and kow-towed.</p>

<p class="indent">He questioned her. At first her answers were vague,
and then it all came out.</p>

<p class="indent">Things had happened. Campanula San had gone into
the town that day, and had met he whose head was like
the rising sun (George du Telle in plain prose); and he
with the sun-bright head had walked with her, and had
spoken dishonorable words. Oh, shame!&mdash;he had offered
her gold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God!&quot; said Leslie, staring at the bent figure on the
matting before him.</p>

<p class="indent">He remained speechless for a moment, then he took
out his watch and looked at it: it was eleven o&#39;clock.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned furiously and strode out of the room: on
the veranda he stopped like a horse suddenly reined in.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane&#39;s image had appeared before him, turning him
back.</p>

<p class="indent">Suppose he were to go to the hotel now and drag
George du Telle out and beat him within an inch of his
life, as was his intention a moment ago?</p>

<p class="indent">The idea of Jane in the midst of that scene brought
his fury down from boiling point.</p>

<p class="indent">He returned to the room, where Lotus-bud was still
on her knees, with her hands clasped.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Where was Campanula San now?</p>

<p class="indent">In bed and asleep. She had returned, it seems, greatly
troubled at noon, and had confided her trouble to Lotus-bud,
making her promise to tell no one&mdash;Leslie San especially&mdash;and
Lotus-bud had promised&mdash;with the result
we have already seen.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment he thought of waking Campanula, but
he dismissed the thought. The thing had occurred and
was irremediable, the question now remained, what was
he to do about George du Telle.</p>

<p class="indent">He went up to bed. In times past he could have obtained
his remedy.</p>

<p class="indent">Where lay his remedy now? The law could do nothing;
there remained only physical force.</p>

<p class="indent">A wheezy pug dog protected by a woman&#39;s skirts, that
is what George du Telle was. Leslie knew that if once
he could catch the brute by the scruff of the neck, the
only struggle would be with himself as to the limits of
chastisement to be inflicted.</p>

<p class="indent">If he could only get him away from Jane up a back
street anywhere, just for five minutes! The thing was
to be done. With the help of the astute M&#39;Gourley he
felt it was to be done, and would be done on the morrow.</p>

<p class="indent">He got up and went to a rack on the wall where he
kept his sticks, and took down a whangee cane half an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
inch thick, a most efficient instrument for the chastisement
of a brute. He made it sing through the air, then
he put it on the rack again and returned to bed, and
slept soundly, far more soundly than he had slept the
night before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="h2">GEORGE DU TELLE</p>

<p class="indent">He was awakened by voices. Sunlight was streaming
into the room, the sparrows were bickering round
the trees, and from below came the voice of Pine-breeze
crying, &quot;Irashi, condescend to enter!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jane&#39;s voice: &quot;I don&#39;t understand what you
say. Stop rubbing the matting with your nose. I want
your master.&quot; Then an octave higher, &quot;Richard!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hullo!&quot; cried Leslie, leaning on his elbow, and
scarcely able to credit his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you are there! Come down at once, I must
speak to you. Quick!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth has happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All sorts of things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be down in two minutes, but for goodness sake
tell me what <i>is</i> the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I speak without any one understanding?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that&#39;s all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
&quot;Well, then, George has bolted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;George has <i>what</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gone away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where has he gone to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! come down and I&#39;ll tell you everything. Dick!
Dick! is that a bath I hear you dragging over the floor?
Dick, if you dare to have the impudence to keep me
waiting whilst you take a bath, I&#39;ll&mdash;I&#39;ll come up and
pull you out of it. Do come on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Directly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don&#39;t be long,&quot; grumbled Jane; and she apparently
took her seat on the cushions upon the matting,
for he could hear her grumbling about the absence
of chairs.</p>

<p class="indent">This was a new development of affairs. George bolted!
It was just what one might have expected of the man,
to insult a girl and then fly from the wrath to come.</p>

<p class="indent">It was rather a relief, too, viewed by the light of morning.
No man likes the task of thrashing a dog that has
misbehaved: the thing has to be done, but it is unpleasant,
and if the creature runs away and hides, so much the
better. And the thrashing of a fat, wheezy pug without
teeth or means of defense was what the punishment
of George du Telle would amount to.</p>

<p class="indent">He dressed rapidly and came down to the room where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
Jane was sitting on a cushion, trying to read the <i>Japan
Mail</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there you are! Come and sit down. No, not
beside me; right opposite, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there&#39;s not much to tell. I was in bed nearly
all yesterday with a headache, and George went off for
a walk in the afternoon; said he was going to call on
<i>you</i>. I told him you had gone to Nagoya.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arita.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all the same&mdash;then he went out, I don&#39;t know
where, and that is the last I&#39;ve seen of him. At nine
yesterday evening they brought me a note saying he had
gone to Osaka, and to follow with our luggage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie whistled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you whistling about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Osaka! Why, that&#39;s over three hundred miles
away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the Inland Sea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it runs from here up to&mdash;well, practically to
Osaka. At least, it doesn&#39;t exactly reach from here, you
have to go through the Straits of Tsu-shima.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t care what Straits you have to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
through; he&#39;s gone to Osaka on important business the
note said. Now, what business can have taken him there.
What do they do at Osaka?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make all sorts of things, from machinery to tea-pots,
and so on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he can&#39;t have gone to buy machinery or tea-pots&mdash;what
can it <i>mean</i>? He was so good, too, yesterday;
brought me up some antipyrine, and wanted to
fetch a doctor, and plumped up my pillows, and then
went out and off to Osaka without a word, and how did
he get there? He says follow by next boat to-morrow.
I was going to ask the hotel people, but I didn&#39;t like to.
I just told them I knew he was going, and I was going to
follow him to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s no railway to Osaka,&quot; said Leslie, &quot;for this
bit of Japan is an island. He must have gone by a Holt
liner; one started last evening. The Canadian Pacific
boats don&#39;t stop at Osaka, they go right on to Yokohama.
I suppose he means for you to follow by the Messagerie
boat that leaves to-morrow evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll give him tea-pots,&quot; said Jane gloomily, &quot;when
I catch him! The idea of his leaving me like that! In
a strange country, too. I wonder <i>what</i> is the meaning
of it all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he went away&mdash;because of a girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;You mean he&#39;s run away with some girl!&quot; flashed
Jane. &quot;Why don&#39;t you say so if you mean it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I don&#39;t mean it. I said &#39;because of a girl,&#39;
not &#39;with a girl.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick, you know something!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane turned pale, and he hated to see her like that, but
he had suddenly made up his mind to tell her all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He met Campanula yesterday afternoon, and, not
to put too fine a point upon it, insulted her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Dick!&quot; said Jane, turning, if possible, paler
than before. She stared at him in a frightened way, then
she recovered herself. &quot;There must be some mistake; she
must have misunderstood him. He couldn&#39;t have done
such a thing; however foolish he may be, he&#39;s a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, a gentleman in England, but not a gentleman
in Japan. He&mdash;God damn it!&quot; blazed out Leslie suddenly,
bringing his fist down with a bang on the matting&mdash;&quot;he
offered her money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go to him at once,&quot; said Jane, making as if
to rise, &quot;and ask him if this thing is true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down for a while; you can&#39;t possibly get to
Osaka to-day. Oh, it&#39;s true enough. I was in a boiling
rage last night when I came home and heard it all. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
was going down to the hotel with a stick to have it out,
and then I thought of you, and the disgrace and uproar
there would be, so I just bit on the bullet and went
to bed. Honestly, I was going to have got him somewhere
by himself to-day, and have it out with him, but
it seems he prefers insulting women to facing men.
Forgive me, Jane, for all this; I feel bitter about it,
but I hate to have to say these things to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was good of you to think of me last night,&quot; said
Jane in a broken voice, gazing at the matting as she
spoke, then looking up full in his face, &quot;very good of
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I suppose it&#39;s really nothing, after all,&quot; he said.
&quot;Those confounded fools that write books about Japan
have got it into English people&#39;s heads that every &#39;Jap-girl,&#39;
as they call them, is a what&#39;s-its-name at heart.
Let&#39;s say no more on the matter, the affair is closed.
Have some breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thanks; I&#39;m too much troubled and worried,&quot;
said Jane, sighing and folding her hands in her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t trouble about it. I told you because&mdash;well,
I thought you ought to know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Richard,&quot; said she, looking up, &quot;if you meet George
again&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be a bit alarmed. I will do nothing to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
except to cut him. He has run away; that closes the
affair entirely. A man can only be really angry with
a man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Richard,&quot; said she, now half tearfully, &quot;I&#39;m going
to say something I want to say. Men don&#39;t understand
women. I&#39;m fond of George. Men are always talking
about love, and so are novels. I never loved George that
way. I don&#39;t think I ever loved any one really in that
way, but I have an affection for George; I suppose that
is the best name to give it. I know he&#39;s ugly, I know
he&#39;s a lot of things he ought not to be, yet I feel he belongs
to me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the sort of feeling one has for an&mdash;for an
animal. I&#39;m just telling you what I feel. An animal
may be terribly ugly, yet one may love it. George has
been very good to me, and he has grown into my life;
that is the only way I can express it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know, Dick, when you have your face very
close to another person&#39;s face you cannot tell what they
are like. Well, it&#39;s just the same with marriage. After
people have been married some time they don&#39;t see each
other as they saw each other before; they have lost their
identity&mdash;each is part of the other. And, Dick, I know
George has been wicked, but ought we not to remember,
the day before yesterday&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said; &quot;the day before yesterday I kissed
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a moment of weakness on my part,&quot; continued
Jane. &quot;We are all very weak and wicked, but
I have always been faithful to my husband&mdash;I should
say, to myself. It is strange to talk like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The whole affair is closed,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us wipe
the slate clean and begin again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sitting opposite to her here in the morning light he
was a very different person from the man wandering
about Arita yesterday, pursued by her image.</p>

<p class="indent">The course of a great passion like his is not a high
level line. If a man were to live through such a phase
of existence at Italian opera heights he would be mad
or dead in a very few days.</p>

<p class="indent">Its course is most like the temperature chart of a typhoid
fever case: tremendous ups and downs, fever point
now, a few hours later almost normal.</p>

<p class="indent">He clapped his hands, and Pine-breeze appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Breakfast,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;ll stay to breakfast,&quot;
turning to Jane. &quot;And there is something I forgot day
before yesterday. You have come to see Japan&mdash;well,
look here&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went to a big lacquer cabinet where he kept his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
papers, and returned with a large, square, cream-colored
card covered with Chinese ideographs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; said Jane, turning it over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An invitation to a garden-party. A man named
Kamamura is giving it to-morrow at O-Mura.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Japanese garden-party!&quot; said Jane, with interest
in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, very Japanese. He told me to bring any of
my friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But to-morrow,&quot; said Jane&mdash;&quot;I am going away to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words went through him like a pang.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind,&quot; he said. &quot;Your boat does not start
till evening; you will have plenty of time to get back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d love to go,&quot; she said; &quot;but&mdash;are you sure it&#39;s
all right for me to go without an invitation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly, or I would not bring you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pine-breeze entered with a tray.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where,&quot; enquired Leslie, &quot;is Campanula San?&quot;
Campanula San had not risen yet; she had a headache.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="h2">RETROSPECTION</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll go up and see her,&quot; said Jane, when they had
finished breakfast. &quot;May I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, if you like; Pine-breeze will show you the way&mdash;but,
Jane, say nothing to her of what occurred yesterday;
she thinks nobody knows except one of the servants
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll say nothing,&quot; replied Jane; &quot;but I&#39;ve got some
antikamnia tabloids in my pocket, fortunately, and I&#39;ll
just make her take one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said Leslie; &quot;but for goodness sake
don&#39;t poison her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was another point on which Jane had not altered.
As a girl she had been possessed by a passion for drugs,
and would swallow anything in the way of medicine she
came across or was given. She had always been doctoring
rabbits and other unfortunate animals, and had once
nearly poisoned herself by taking half a bottle of pain-killer
for a dose. And now here she was, nearly fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
years after, in Japan, going upstairs to doctor Campanula,
with just the same manner and seriousness of
face with which long ago, medicine bottle in hand, she
would give the order: &quot;Prize its mouth open, Dick;
don&#39;t hurt it. Steady now, I&#39;m going to pour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Quarter of an hour later she came down triumphant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She took it like a lamb. She&#39;s the dearest child!
Now I&#39;m off. I have a hundred things to do. Will you
walk down with me as far as the hotel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He accompanied her to the hotel, and neither of them
spoke much on the way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t ask you in,&quot; said Jane, when they reached
the door, &quot;because it wouldn&#39;t be proper. Now let me
see. To-morrow is the garden-party; we might do something
to-day, you and Campanula and I&mdash;might
not we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We could run over to Mogi,&quot; he said. &quot;We can get
rikshas, have luncheon there, and come back to tea at
my place; and to-night there&#39;s an affair on at the O Suwa
temple, we might go there. Shall I call for you at
twelve or so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, &quot;if you&#39;ll bring a chaperon. You
see, now George is away I must be awfully &#39;propindicular,&#39;
like that person in Uncle Remus&mdash;the Terrapin&mdash;wasn&#39;t
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ll bring Campanula&mdash;or one of the Mousm&egrave;s, at
a pinch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Campanula chaperoning me!&quot; said Jane with a
laugh. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s only for the sake of
Mrs. Grundy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no Japanese Mrs. Grundy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but there is an English one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They parted, and Jane entered the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">She went to her bedroom, got her writing-case out
of a portmanteau, and began to write. She was writing
a letter to George.</p>

<p class="indent">The first began:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Your abominable conduct has been discovered. You
have heaped shame on me, you have heaped shame on
yourself&mdash;&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">When she got as far as this she found that it was too
melodramatic, somehow, and the &quot;heaped shames&quot; did
not ring true, so she tore it up and began again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;My cousin, Richard Leslie, sent for me this morning
in great distress. <i>How</i> you could have acted as you did
towards that sweet child surpasses me. Fortunately for
yourself you have run away&mdash;&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">She tore this up too, flew into a temper with herself,
and then wrote as follows:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">George</span>,&mdash;I&#39;ve heard everything. Dick is furious, but
he&#39;s not going to do anything, so just stay at Osaka till I
come, and don&#39;t go bolting off anywhere else. And don&#39;t
drink too much port, for if you get another attack of gout
<i>I</i> won&#39;t nurse you.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She sealed this classical epistle and addressed it. Then
she remembered that she might just as well have left it
unwritten, for there was no communication to be had
with Osaka till the morrow; and if she posted it, it would
go by the same boat as herself. So she tore it up.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she sat down on the side of her bed and bit a
corner of her handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">She was thinking.</p>

<p class="indent">To-morrow she would never see Dick again, most
probably, after that.</p>

<p class="indent">She had never loved Dick, that is to say in the good
old <i>Family Herald</i> way. Their boy and girl relationship
had been anything but sentimental.</p>

<p class="indent">Recalling the past she could conjure up no tender
pictures.</p>

<p class="indent">She could see herself clinging to a rod bent like a
bow, and shouting to Dick: &quot;Now then, chucklehead,
gaff him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She could see herself tramping after him like a squaw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
after a chief on rabbiting expeditions&mdash;dozens of pictures
like this, but none of them sentimental. She had
never thought of marriage till the day she received a
letter from Dick, asking her to marry him; to which she
replied by writing half a dozen letters refusing him,
which letters she tore up one after the other, and then
wrote a seventh accepting him, which she posted.</p>

<p class="indent">Now one of the worst evils in an accepted proposal
of marriage is this. That directly they hear of it, the
girl&#39;s relations, male and female, take their implements&mdash;nets,
ferrets, and so on&mdash;and go off rabbiting in your
past.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick had not much of a past as far as size goes, but
it was well stocked with game for hunters such as these.</p>

<p class="indent">So well stocked that old Mr. Deering, a retired London
wine merchant who had taken a country seat in Scotland,
near Glenbruach, put his foot down and forbade
Jane to have anything more to do with her cousin: an
order which would have driven her straight into his arms,
had not the unfortunate Dick, hearing of the inquisition
that had been made, come North inflamed with rage and
whisky.</p>

<p class="indent">Men drank harder even in the &#39;eighties than they do
now, and Scotland was never the home of abstinence;
yet the scene Dick Leslie created in Callander went beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
the bounds of even Scottish convention, and utterly
destroyed any chance of his marriage with Jane du Telle.</p>

<p class="indent">Remembering his description of the affair which he
gave to M&#39;Gourley on the Nikko road, you will agree
with me that he was not a man who viewed his own acts&mdash;well,
as others viewed them.</p>

<p class="indent">In this, however, he was by no means singular.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane, sitting on her bed and biting the corner of her
handkerchief, was at the same time looking back back
over the past. She was a person with an infinite capacity
for affection, with no capacity at all for a Grand Passion.
Her life was made up of a bundle of petty interests,
and her history was the history of a pure and
somewhat commonplace soul.</p>

<p class="indent">She had loved Dick as a brother in the past, and now
that he had come into her life again after all those years
(even after that terrible scene long ago), bringing with
him so much from the happy days that were for ever
gone, her heart went out to him as it had never gone to
human being before.</p>

<p class="indent">And to-morrow she must say good-bye to him, and
never, perhaps, see him again.</p>

<p class="indent">They must part; there was no other thing to be done.
She was her own mistress, with plenty of money at her
command; she could have flown in the face of society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
and made Dick forever her own. Such a course did not
even occur to her, for she was a creature bound by the
laws of convention, almost as rigidly as you or I by
the laws of gravity.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of very light-heartedness she would do things and
say things that would have been dangerous symptoms in
a woman of a sterner mold; and men had often pursued
her, led on by this laughing spirit that vanished behind
a veil, which, being lifted, disclosed an adamant door.</p>

<p class="indent">Her great danger lay in her compassionate emotions,
and all the womanly nature that lay behind them. Her
great danger lay in Richard Leslie, for he was the only
being that had ever aroused them to their full strength.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once she cast herself upon the bed, and after
the fashion of her childhood, buried her face in a pillow,
and sobbed, and &quot;grat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When she had occupied herself thus for some ten
minutes, she rose and looked at herself in the glass, and
wondered at her own distorted image, and how she could
possibly be such a fool. But she felt better; the pain
of parting with Dick was not quite so bad, and she felt
kindlier towards George.</p>

<p class="indent">If his conduct had taken place in England, I doubt if
her anger would have been so soon assuaged. But they
were in Japan&mdash;and the Japs, you know!&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="h2">THE BROKEN LATH</p>

<p class="indent">A heat wave from the Pacific had stolen over Nagasaki,
and the windless night was filled with
stars and lights.</p>

<p class="indent">Stars in the sky, and stars in the harbor, long wavy
reflections of light from the ships in the anchorage, and
ten thousand lanterns spangling the mysterious city.</p>

<p class="indent">A spangle of colored lamps that spread away to the
base of the O Suwa hill which they stormed, covering it
with a thousand sparkles like phosphoric sea-spray, and
cresting its summit with a burning zone, bright as the
snow crest of Fuji.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a gala night, and the O Suwa, that galaxy of
temples, had called the true believers in love and beauty
to worship in the name of religion.</p>

<p class="indent">From the great double temple, which is the crowning
glory of the hill, Leslie and his companions looked down
upon shrine after shrine, broad flights of steps stained
with the soft amber and pink of lantern light, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
colored crowd ever shifting, and murmurous as the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">The shadow spaces and the vagueness of night made
great distances in this dim but splendid picture, till the
moon, rising over the hill-top, chased the shadows away,
paled the lamps, and drew the distances together.</p>

<p class="indent">Touched by her light the crowd below became sonorous
as a musical glass touched by the finger; the murmur
of voices, the ripple of laughter, the sigh of moving
silk and the flutter of a thousand fans intensified,
rose blended and mixed, and dwelt in the air a nimbus
of sound. The native city beyond grew more distinct,
yet more unreal in the moonlight, which strengthened
the black shadows of the wooded cliffs and converted the
harbor into a trembling mirror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall never see anything again so beautiful as
that,&quot; said Jane, &quot;so mysterious, so strange.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not reply. A small hand had stolen into his;
it was Campanula&#39;s. She, too, was gazing at the scene
around and below them, filled with who knows what
thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">They were not alone here on the utmost heights;
women, gayly dressed, were passing into the temple behind
them to pray and clap their hands before their
gods. Women surrounded them, laughing, chattering,
dispelling quaint perfumes on the air from large incessantly-waving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
fans. From the tea houses behind the
temple came the thready music of <i>cham&egrave;cens</i> and sounds
of unseen festivity; and from the great park beyond,
through the hot night, the perfume of azaleas and the
odor of the dew-wet cryptomeria trees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; said Jane, &quot;let us go and take the picture
with us before it gets dulled. I will never forget this
night&mdash;there is something in the air of this place I have
never felt before. No, thanks, I don&#39;t want to see the
tea houses, I am quite content with this; let us go down
right through it, and home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They descended the broad flights of steps through
the murmuring, laughing, and perfumed crowd. There
was something in the air indeed, something as intoxicating
as wine, yet far more subtle, subtle as a poison
or a love philter.</p>

<p class="indent">They found rikshas to take them back, and the whole
party returned to the hotel, where they left Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow at noon,&quot; she said to Leslie, as she
turned to enter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, or even a little later; the train doesn&#39;t start till
after one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night!&quot; She waved her hand in the lamplit
portico and vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">They had no need of lanterns to show the way up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
the hill-path to the House of the Clouds; the path was
a tangle of moonlight and lilac-bough shadows, a tremulous
carpet upon which above them they perceived a
creeping and colored thing.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Cherry-blossom. She, too, had been at the
festival at the O Suwa, and was now returning, wearied
out and walking like a somnambulist, a lantern painted
with butterflies held before her nodding at the end of
a bamboo cane.</p>

<p class="indent">In the house, when he had fastened the shoji and taken
his night lantern from Pine-breeze, he turned to where
Campanula was standing, a vague figure in the dimly-lit
room. Yielding to a sudden impulse he picked her up
from the ground, just as he might have picked up a
child, and kissed her&mdash;kissed her just as he had kissed
her when she was a child that day, years ago, in the
valley by the Nikko road.</p>

<p class="indent">That night sleep was impossible. The lights of the
O Suwa burned before him, the perfume of the azaleas
and cryptomerias pursued him, lighting always and
leading him always to the same image&mdash;Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">He lay considering what the future would be when
Jane was gone; the rainy season would soon be upon
them, and then the autumn and the winter and the spring
again after that, and the years to come.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
Whilst thus torturing his soul his mind was steadfastly
making a resolve. A resolve that, come what
might, Jane must not go out of his life. That to-morrow
he must act in such a way as to make her for ever his
own.</p>

<p class="indent">Come what might!</p>

<p class="indent">There was no time left for thought, scarcely enough
for action.</p>

<p class="indent">He had quite ceased to battle with himself, to say this
is right or this is wrong. Time had cut all these arguments
short with the command: &quot;Act now, now, in the
next twenty-four hours! for after that your chance is
gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he began to sketch out the plan that had been
vaguely forming in his brain all the evening&mdash;a plan
that the villainous conduct of George du Telle made possible
and practicable, and, to Leslie&#39;s mind, almost
plausible.</p>

<p class="indent">As he lay thus, a faint sigh came through the lattice
of the window. The wind had risen, and was moving
the cherry branches and the azaleas.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came another sound&mdash;the sound of a stick tapping
on the garden path, as if some blind person were
cautiously feeling their way round the house.</p>

<p class="indent">Up along the garden path, pausing now, now advancing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
now dying away, now returning, somebody was
promenading in front of the house, keeping watch and
ward like a sentry, somebody whose feet made no sound,
somebody blind.</p>

<p class="indent">A feeling of sick terror came over him&mdash;terror not to
be borne.</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled the mosquito-net aside, and rose, shivering
and trembling, feeling that he must look out at all hazards&mdash;even
at the worst.</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled the slats aside and looked out. Nobody.
The moonlight lay on the azaleas and the garden path,
but of the prowler there was no sign.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he saw the cause of the sound. A lath broken
from the house wall was hanging with tip touching the
path, and tapping upon it as the wind shook it.</p>

<p class="indent">He returned to bed, and tried to snatch a few hours&#39;
sleep, but the sound of the blind man tapping his way
continued all night long&mdash;now faint, now loud, and insistent
as the wind rose and fell.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE &quot;EMPRESS OF JAPAN&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If Mr. Kamamura had sent a special messenger to
Paradise to pick from the aviary there a blue-winged
and bright-eyed day for his garden-party, he would not
have obtained a better one than that which came by
chance.</p>

<p class="indent">A haze hid its coming. Just after sunrise, looking
from Leslie&#39;s garden one could scarcely see Nagasaki
down below&mdash;a toy town, seen through faint blue gauze,
it seemed. The wind came in puffs, hot from the Pacific,
shaking the cherry branches.</p>

<p class="indent">The great double cherry-blossoms were falling. The
close, even moss under the trees was white, like ground
after a mild snowstorm.</p>

<p class="indent">There was something in the atmosphere which loosened
the petals this morning. At each puff of wind a
fresh shower fell, sifting through the air to scatter softly
on the ground. It was a ghostly sight in the gray and
silent dawn; the trees seemed despoiling themselves, casting
their blossoms from them in sorrow or fear.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
In the veranda stood the crimson garden umbrella,
all damp with dew, and four pairs of dogs in a row.
The house was deathly still; and one might have likened
it to a tomb, had it not possessed so much the appearance
of a bandbox, looped and latticed.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently a faint sound might have been heard. A
panel slid back, and a figure appeared, holding in its
hand a lighted paper lantern.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Campanula, clad in blue, her feet peeping from
beneath her skirt like two white mice.</p>

<p class="indent">She put out the lantern, and hung it on a hook. Then
she put on a pair of clogs, and clicked down the steps.
She went down the path, through the little gate, and vanished
from sight; and as her footsteps died away, silence
returned to the house and the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">Then in a few minutes a glorious transformation scene
took place. The haze turned to a golden mist; it became
sundered by rivers of clear air, and from it leaped the
sun, like Helios from the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly the silence of the orchard became broken
by the bickering of birds; a cock crowed somewhere in
the back premises, and he was answered by the cock that
lived half-way down the hill at the cooper&#39;s shop&mdash;who
was answered, a minute later, by all the roosters in
Nagasaki.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
The mist vanished entirely now, the sun began steadily
to mount into the vault of perfect blue; his slanting
rays shot through the cherry orchard, striking here the
bole of a tree glistening with great tears of fragrant
gum, and there on the ground besnowed with blossom,
even the fierce old hills of the landscape garden lost
something of their ruggedness in the warm and mellow
light.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the house began to awaken. Pine-breeze appeared
on the veranda, and after Pine-breeze the other
Mousm&egrave;s all busy, or appearing so, dragging out futon
to air for a moment in the morning brightness, and
lacquer screens to be dusted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Summer has come in the night,&quot; said Lotus-bud,
pointing out the fallen cherry-blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; chimed in Pine-breeze, &quot;but spring has
gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dreamt last night of frost.&quot; This from Cherry-blossom,
who was busily engaged watching the others
at work.</p>

<p class="indent">Frost is a bad dream in Japan, and the Mousm&egrave;s
conferred in murmurs as to what it might mean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; said Lotus-bud suddenly, with an air of
conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
&quot;The riksha man will die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which?&quot; asked Pine-breeze.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the two Mousm&egrave;s began to &quot;guy&quot; Cherry-blossom
as to the number of the riksha man destined to
die.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ichi-ban, Ni-ban, San-ban,&quot;[3] murmured Lotus-bud.</p>

<p class="indent">[Footnote 3: Number one, number two, number three.]</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shi-ban, Go-ban, Roku-ban,&quot; rippled Pine-breeze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hachi-ban!&quot; suddenly cried Lotus-bud, with an air
of inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ku-ban!&quot; replied Pine-breeze, with the air of going
one better.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leslie San!&quot; said Cherry-blossom: and Pine-breeze
got up and scuttered into the house, where Leslie San
was calling for his bath to be heated.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later he appeared on the veranda, fully
dressed.</p>

<p class="indent">He noticed the promise of heat in the air; he noted
the great fall of cherry-blossoms that had occurred
during the night; he noted the lantern that Campanula
had hung on the hook.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he left the veranda, came down into the garden
path, and through the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside the gate there was a little by-path that led
upwards and to the left, between a double bank of bushes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
to an open space like a natural platform, from which a
splendid view of the harbor and hills could be obtained,
A great camellia tree forty feet high grew here, alone
in its splendor, and beneath it he stood gazing at the
harbor.</p>

<p class="indent">He could hear the faint monosyllabic cry of the
brown hawks ever circling above the blue water, and
the distant sound of a drum from the <i>Rurik</i> where she
lay at anchor. He could see the sampans shooting hither
and thither, carrying fruit and what not to the ships
in the anchorage, and the Junks floating like brown
phantoms past the shadow of the opposite cliffs.</p>

<p class="indent">But his eye was searching for something that was not
there.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at his watch, put it back in his pocket
with an impatient gesture, and continued to gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly&mdash;Hrr-&#39;mph!&mdash;Haa-aar!&mdash;the blast of a
syren came shouting up the harbor, and chasing the
echoes through the hills. The brown hawks rose and
circled in wild flight, and past a bend came a great,
white, double-funneled steamer.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the Canadian Pacific boat, the <i>Empress of
Japan</i>, touching at Nagasaki, and due to leave the
morning following for Yokohama and Vancouver.</p>

<p class="indent">He watched her for a moment as she swam to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
berth, beautiful and graceful as a swan. Then he turned
to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">To-morrow morning he and Jane would be on board
that boat, bound northward up the Inland Sea, past
Tsu-shima, past Osaka, past Yokohama, and away across
the blue Pacific to Vancouver.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole plan was cut and dried. Jane had given no
consent; that did not matter. She would consent; he felt
the power in himself to <i>make</i> her consent.</p>

<p class="indent">Men of his stamp, lazy, neurotic, yet strong-willed,
stung into action by love or hate, sometimes assume
momentary but terrible command over events; they infect
with their passion, infuriate with their hate, or paralyze
with their love.</p>

<p class="indent">He entered the house, ordered breakfast, and enquired
for Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">She had gone down at dawn, said Pine-breeze, to see
O Toku San, the poor girl who was so ill, and was now
dying. He was glad Campanula was out, and determined
if possible to get his preparations over before her return.
Jane and he would return from Mr. Kamamura&#39;s
about six that evening. It would be time enough then to
tell Campanula of his journey.</p>

<p class="indent">As he breakfasted, he completed that part of his plans
which had reference to Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
She would be safe and well looked after by M&#39;Gourley,
till&mdash;he came back. He told himself he would come back
some day; perhaps in six months or so he would come
back.</p>

<p class="indent">And why should he worry about leaving Campanula
for a time? He had often gone away before, once as far
as London; he had always come back.</p>

<p class="indent">Why should Campanula mind his going away again?</p>

<p class="indent">Why, indeed!</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to forget how her little hand had stolen into
his on the evening before as if for protection. How,
when he had kissed her, she had suddenly flung aside her
timid reserve, and with her arms around his neck, but
without a word, had told him what only a woman can
tell without speech.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps it was because he loved her far more than he
knew, that his mind was filled with gloom and apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was the time for action, not for thought; only
a few hours lay before him in which to prepare for this
journey&mdash;the journey from which he would return quite
soon perhaps.</p>

<p class="indent">He would leave the house just as it was to Campanula
and the Mousm&egrave;s till he came back and made other arrangements.
M&#39;Gourley, as his agent, would supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
them with all the money needful just as he had done
before.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he called Pine-breeze and told her to get his
portmanteau up to his room, as he was going on a
journey.</p>

<p class="indent">He packed hurriedly, whilst Lotus-bud handed him
things. He wanted to get the packing over and done
with.</p>

<p class="indent">The strong sunlight reflected from the matting lit up
the room with a golden glow. Pine-breeze in the kitchen
below was singing a song about a lilac bough&mdash;the same
song he had heard in the orchard that day when Campanula
had cried: &quot;Hist, some one at the gate!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned back sitting on his heels to listen. He heard
the end of the song now. He did not hear it that day,
for Jane, knocking at the veranda, had cut it short.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the gist of the last verse:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;<i>The bee comes no more</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>When the lilac&#39;s white blossom is dead</i>.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then he went on with his packing at a furious rate,
stuffing in shirts, collars, handkerchiefs, his mind wandering
over all sorts of subjects.</p>

<p class="indent">His packing finished, he went to the window, took out
his pocketbook, and examined its contents. Three hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
and ten pounds, half in circular notes, half in notes
of the Bank of England.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he took out a check-book and a stylograph pen,
and wrote a check for five hundred, payable to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes later he was in a riksha making for the
Bund, where he stopped at Holme &amp; Ringers, the shipping
agents, bought two first-class tickets for Vancouver,
and changed his check, receiving part in cash, and
part in a check upon the National Specie Bank of Yokohama.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now eleven o&#39;clock, and he had practically completed
his preparations. He had now to see Mac, and he
turned his steps to the office, which was only a stone&#39;s
throw from the shipping agents. Mac was writing
letters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morning,&quot; said he, glancing up, and seeming surprised
to see his partner at that hour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s agate?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am,&quot; said Leslie, trying to assume a jovial manner.
&quot;I&#39;m off for a holiday, and I want you to look
after things same as you&#39;ve done before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is sudden,&quot; said Mac, going on with his correspondence
without looking up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s never too sudden for a holiday. And see
here, I&#39;d better leave you some ready cash: here&#39;s a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
check for two fifty. I want you to look after the bairn
whilst I&#39;m away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep the money,&quot; said Mac, &quot;and pay me&mdash;when
y&#39; come back. Ay, ay, it&#39;ll be soon enough then&mdash;soon
enough then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d sooner leave you the money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weel, put it in that drawer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you <i>are</i> a bear this morning. See here, I&#39;ve
put it in the drawer, but I&#39;ll see you again before I go:
I&#39;m not off till to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Imphim!&quot; replied the Dour One, and Leslie went off.</p>

<p class="indent">Your true Scot has a very nasty habit of expressing
his bad opinion of a man. He does it in a round-about
way, using hints and innuendoes, instead of coming to
the matter by a direct route.</p>

<p class="indent">What Mac suspected or what he knew, Leslie could not
tell; judging from his manner, however, he knew or suspected
a lot.</p>

<p class="indent">However, he had no time to trouble about Mac. He
had one thing more to do before meeting Jane, Mr.
Initogo the landlord had to be interviewed, and the rent
paid.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a fair of a sort on in the street that
formed the shortest cut to Mr. Initogo&#39;s. It was filled
with a many-colored crowd, flags were fluttering, awnings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
flapping in the wind; every shop had some extra
advertisement to attract customers, and during the past
night, like mushrooms, extra booths had sprung into
being.</p>

<p class="indent">A roaring trade was going forward; here, all kinds of
fruit, there all kinds of fish, some with bunches of violets
in their mouths; cakes reposing on branches of cherry
or myrtle; cakes in the form of donkeys and monkeys
and goats; cakes shaped like spinning-tops; cakes in the
shape of suns, moons and stars; candied beans, beans
mixed with comfits, kites, masks, and paper dragons.
Paper fish shaped like carp for the Little-boys&#39; Festival
of the 5th of May.</p>

<p class="indent">The noise and bustle somehow pleased Leslie, and
soothed him; and he drifted along with the chattering
stream of men, women, Mousm&egrave;s, little boys and mere
babies. Some of the children had long, curved trumpets
of glass, from which they blew the most horrible of
hobgoblin sounds. Here a man was frying pancakes,
wrapping them in rice paper, and flinging them to unseen
customers in the crowd, who flung him back the
money. Here a person in spectacles, who looked like a
professor of chemistry gone mad, was blowing from a
glass-blower&#39;s tube dragons and fish in sugar-candy.
Apothecaries, with great golden eyes painted on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
booths, were selling little rice paper charms, one to be
taken dissolved in water for the stomach-ache, two for
lumbago, three for migraine. Here stood a man who
would pull your teeth out with his fingers, three sen a
tooth.</p>

<p class="indent">The cheap curio dealers were in evidence with their
wares cheap and bad; those quaint perambulating curio
dealers, who, as a rule, only start business at sundown,
and whose stock-in-trade include old top hats, old boots,
old&mdash;anything&mdash;European. &quot;Caw&mdash;caw&mdash;caw!&quot; You
look up, and see a great kite straining at its strings.</p>

<p class="indent">And then the umbrellas! Leslie had a good view of
them, for he was head and shoulders taller than any one
in the crowd. Red, pink, gray, gray-green, pink-and-white,
blossom-bestrewn, stork-bestrewn, a shifting mass
of color reflecting the sunlight.</p>

<p class="indent">But though he saw all this, and though the noise and
bustle and laughter and general atmosphere of festivity
fell in with his humor, his thoughts were far away at
Osaka; he was wondering what George du Telle was
doing, and what George du Telle would say in a day or
so, and how he would look. He had never hated George
du Telle really till now that he had determined to rob
him of his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that he was about to commit, or attempt to commit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
a vile and abominable act against George du Telle,
that person seemed to him the acme of all things vile and
abominable.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, through an opening in the crowd, Leslie
caught a glimpse of a face, the face of a blind man,
stolid, stony, with a flattened nose and wearing an indescribable
expression of eld, weariness, and misfortune.</p>

<p class="indent">It was only a momentary glimpse, but revealed just
for a moment, and contrasted with the shifting colored
mass around him, with the noise and laughter, the sunlight
and the movement of life, it was like a vision of
death.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie stood for a moment startled and chilled; the
joyous exaltation in his mind a moment ago had vanished:
it was as if a cloud had come between him and the
sun.</p>

<p class="indent">Why were these things always occurring to fret his
soul and trouble his imagination? This blind man was
nothing but an ordinary blind man of Japan such as one
might see any day. The broken lath that had troubled
him all night was but a broken lath; the song of the
mushi that had started that infernal sound in his head
was but the sound of an insect buzzing; the azalea that
had caused that frightful dream was but a flower.</p>

<p class="indent">These slight things, he told himself, acting on a brain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
made over-sensitive by opium, were not warnings, but
simple causes of complex effects. And he passed on his
way, cursing himself for a fool, till he reached the shop
of Mr. Initogo.</p>

<p class="indent">That gentleman, for a wonder, was not making tea,
but the sight of Leslie San instantly inspired the desire
for his favorite beverage, caused him to clap his hands,
and the tea-tray to appear in the hands of his wife
almost instantly upon the sound.</p>

<p class="indent">He received his rent, which he put away with an appearance
of indifference, expressed sorrow on hearing
that Leslie was going away for even a short time, but
joy at the thought that the journey might benefit his
honorable health.</p>

<p class="indent">He was really fond of Leslie, this old Japanese gentleman;
but the worst of the flowery Japanese language is
that it remains always, so to speak, at boiling point, and
towards friend or perfect stranger is the same. You
can&#39;t cool it, and you can&#39;t warm it.</p>

<p class="indent">Whilst they were talking Kiku came in; her eyes were
red and she had a snuffle in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been, it seems, to see the poor girl who was
dying, O Toku San; Campanula was with her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; said Mr. Initogo, as his daughter retired
upstairs. &quot;Most sad, poor girl. A man whom she loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
left her, and she is dying of it, just as a flower dies from
want of water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie looked at his watch: it was after twelve. He
hastened from the shop of Mr. Initogo, and securing a
riksha drove to the Nagasaki Hotel on the Bund.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="h2">M&#39;GOURLEY&#39;S LOVE AFFAIR</p>

<p class="indent">At about three o&#39;clock on that eventful day M&#39;Gourley
met one of Holme &amp; Ringer&#39;s clerks in the
street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So your partner&#39;s off for a holiday,&quot; said the clerk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he tells me,&quot; replied Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s going pretty far afield,&quot; went on the clerk;
&quot;Vancouver isn&#39;t&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you say?&quot; cut in M&#39;Gourley.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he&#39;s bought two tickets for Vancouver this
morning, one for his cousin and one for himself. She
is married, and they are going to pick her husband up
at Yokohama,&quot; he went on, smiling slightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Vancouver!&quot; said Mac. He stood for a moment in
astonishment, then hailing a passing riksha he jumped
into it, and told the driver to take him to the House of
the Clouds.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula had just returned, she was in the garden;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
and when she heard his step coming up the hill path she
came to the gate to meet him.</p>

<p class="indent">She greeted him with a smile, but there was something
about her that struck M&#39;Gourley strangely.</p>

<p class="indent">She had a far-away look in her face, and she wore an
abstracted air. Away from the world her mind seemed
wandering in some far, strange country, whilst her little
body walked beside him, and her lips answered his questions,
and told him things.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Toku San is dead,&quot; said she; &quot;I have just left
her.&quot; She spoke gravely, but without any sorrow in her
voice; one might even have imagined that she was referring
to some good fortune that had fallen on O Toku
San; and perhaps, indeed, she was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay! puir thing, is she?&quot; said Mac, whose mind was
also astray.</p>

<p class="indent">He asked had Leslie returned, and Campanula told
him that he had gone to a garden-party at Omura, and
would not return till evening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is going away,&quot; finished Campanula, pausing
on the veranda steps and unlatching the strap of her
sandal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! so he&#39;s told you?&quot; said Mac.</p>

<p class="indent">Campanula said nothing; possibly she did not hear
the question, so absorbed was she by her own ideas and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
thoughts. Suddenly she said, turning to Mac, who was
leaning his shoulder against the veranda post and feeling
in his pocket for his tobacco-pouch:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw the Blind One to-day as I was leaving O Toku
San&#39;s. I did not speak to him; he spoke to me. He said
the master of the house on the heights is going on a
journey from whence he will not return. Then he went
away. A wind from the hill blew my kimono apart and
a chill came to my breast. I do not know who the Blind
One is&mdash;perhaps he is Death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley, as she spoke, noticed that she had refolded
her kimono from right to left instead of from left to
right.</p>

<p class="indent">Now in Japan, the only people who wear their
kimonos folded from right to left are the dead.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt sick and shivery at the words she had just
spoken, and he could not reply to them or ask questions;
he was filled with a horror of the subject, a dead, blind
terror of it. He looked down and said gruffly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What way is that you&#39;ve folded your kimono? Just
run into the house and put it right. I&#39;ll bide here on the
verandy and smoke my pipe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She vanished into the house, and Mac sat down, but he
did not light his pipe. What could be the meaning of
all this? Surely he was dead, and laid long ago in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
green woods of Nikko&mdash;could it be possible that the
dead return?</p>

<p class="indent">Why was it that she alone could see him, hear him,
and speak to him?</p>

<p class="indent">His eye caught the crimson azaleas as they bloomed
in their beauty and splendor, and the Nikko road rose
before him, the mysterious valley, peopled by the crimson
flowers, the cypress trees, the far-off country, and
the distant sea hills beyond Tanagura.</p>

<p class="indent">He heard Leslie&#39;s voice as it denied the existence
of God, and declared that if he had ever been given a
creature that loved him, he would have cared for and
loved it.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he felt something touch his shoulder, and, turning
with a start, found it was Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; said she, in the manner of a person who
would say, &quot;I wish to show you something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rose and followed her into the house. She led the
way upstairs, and down the narrow passage to Leslie&#39;s
room.</p>

<p class="indent">At the door she paused and pointed to an object on
the floor. It was a portmanteau packed and strapped.</p>

<p class="indent">They both looked at it without saying a word: a
silence, that spoke of the deep, unconscious understanding
between them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
&quot;Come,&quot; said Mac in his turn, and taking her by
the hand he led her downstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Had the portmanteau been a coffin, containing some
being beloved by Campanula, he could not have spoken
more gently, or led her away from it more tenderly.</p>

<p class="indent">Downstairs the old, rough, gruff M&#39;Gourley seemed
very much perturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">Could he have found Leslie alone at that moment, a
very regrettable scene might have ensued.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet at the bottom of all his anger and perturbation
lay a golden gleam. If Leslie went off like this,
Campanula would be all his (Mac&#39;s) own.</p>

<p class="indent">He had no idea of marrying her, or anything of that
sort; but he had an immense idea of possessing her all
for himself.</p>

<p class="indent">He had, proposed to buy a half share in her at Nikko,
and he would have made a bad bargain, for during the
last five years he had possessed a full half share without
paying a cent, unless we count the pounds and pounds
expended on dolls, sweets, and so forth.</p>

<p class="indent">But this was not like having her all to himself: a creature
to feed and clothe, to buy hairpins for and tabis,
fans and sweets; to listen to of an evening, as her fingers
strayed over the strings of a <i>cham&egrave;cen</i>, or her tongue
told fabulous tales of folk clad in fur or feathers.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once, as he paced the room, he turned to her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
literally picked her up, hugged her, gave her a kiss, and
said: &quot;He&#39;ll come back to you. Dinna greet; I canna
stand it. I&#39;ll be back and see you the morrow morn before
he goes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He hurried out of the house, and went raging down
the hill.</p>

<p class="indent">To be in anger with one whom one loves works, indeed,
like madness in the blood.</p>

<p class="indent">Mac, as he plunged down the hill, was lashing himself
into a fury against Leslie. He turned into a saki shop
and drank half a pint of that seemingly innocuous
liquor; then he went to the office, took a whisky bottle
from a cupboard, and poured himself out a liberal peg.</p>

<p class="indent">He was an abstemious man as a rule, but once he took
the bit between his teeth nothing on God&#39;s earth except
death would stop him, till the next morning&#39;s headache
came.</p>

<p class="indent">At five he recognized that he was hopelessly embarked
on a grand drunk, and determined to take a riksha over
to Mogi; there complete the business, and return in time
next morning to see Leslie before he started.</p>

<p class="indent">Just before starting from the hotel a waiter brought
him out a cablegram from Shanghai, which had come
round from the office. It was relative to a bank disaster
that had occurred in India. He read it, stuffed it into
his pocket, and ordered the Djin to proceed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="h2">THE GARDEN-PARTY</p>

<p class="indent">Within an hour of the great city of Nagasaki,
in the midst of a park that was at the same
time half a garden, lay the country residence of Mr.
Kamamura; once a man who carried two swords, with
the longer of which he would have beheaded you for
two words and have done it with neatness and despatch,
now a gentleman in a frock-coat and tall hat, wearing
gold-rimmed glasses and a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The long, low house, white as snow and surrounded by
a narrow veranda, faced west, and was surrounded by
a garden recalling the gardens of Dai Nichi Do: a garden
filled with the music of fountains and the poetry of
birds.</p>

<p class="indent">Alas! on the day of his garden-party Mr. Kamamura,
seized with the spirit of modernity and the savagery
of civilization, not content with the music of
heaven, and prompted, no doubt, by the devil, had hired
a brass band and placed it in a little kiosk, with orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
to bray Strauss in the face of Nature from three o&#39;clock
till dusk.</p>

<p class="indent">There were many guests, and the gardens soon presented
an animated appearance. Many of the ladles had
retained the national dress, and marvelous were the
fabrics to be seen in the form of the obi or flowing loose
in the graceful kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the guests surrounded a pair of jugglers,
two terrible men dressed in red, who fenced with and
transfixed one another with long swords, swallowed fire,
and belched it like dragons.</p>

<p class="indent">In another corner of the grounds fireworks were whizzing
and cracking, filling the clear air above with a thin
blue haze through which, just as Jane and Leslie entered
the grounds, there rose a wonderful fire balloon made of
colored paper and fashioned in the form of a turkey
cock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s like a party in the lunatic asylum,&quot; whispered
Jane, as they threaded the maze of guests in search of
their host and hostess. &quot;And, Dick, you <i>do</i> look perfectly
awful in that panama amongst all these men in
tall hats&mdash;I mean they look awful beside you, but they
are <i>de rigueur</i>; and it&#39;s better to be <i>de rigueur</i> and look
frightful, than to be not <i>de rigueur</i> and look nice. How
d&#39;y&#39; do?&quot; and Jane extended her arm, pump-handle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
fashion, to the little gentleman with the sallow face to
whom Leslie was introducing her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Much pleasure, much pleasure,&quot; said Mr. Kamamura,
whose English was mixed and limited, and who, like
Kiku San, had not completely mastered the letter &quot;l.&quot;
&quot;Will the honorable rady so make equal health Nagysaki
(the proper way to pronounce Nagasaki) you stay?
So good. Over there Mrs. Kamamura; you make
known;&quot; and Mr. Kamamura presenting his arm Jane
was led away through the crowd like some tall and graceful
frigate threading a maze of painted cock-boats.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie, left to himself, turned with a gloomy expression
of countenance to where the jugglers were dislocating
each other&#39;s necks. He did not see them; he was
looking out of the side of his eyes at Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been led across one of the willow-pattern
bridges, and he could see her now standing at one of the
kiosks, a tea-cup in her hand. She was talking to Mr.
Kamamura and a little lady in European dress&mdash;Mrs.
Kamamura, probably.</p>

<p class="indent">What could they be talking about? Conversation,
probably, sufficient to dislocate the gravity of a Socrates.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned his head impatiently and tried to take an
interest in the jugglers, without success. There was
something deeply irritating about the scene of frivolity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
in which Fate had staged the last scenes of the most important
act in his life.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Empress of Japan</i> sailed at eight on the morrow
morning, and as yet he had made no movement as regards
Jane. All this trifling was but a bad prelude to
those words so soon to be spoken.</p>

<p class="indent">He little knew that Tragedy stood at his elbow in the
form of James Anderson, manager to M&#39;Cormick, the
great silk dealers on the Bund.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Leslie, man! I thought I knew the nape of
your neck. How are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hullo, Anderson!&quot; said Leslie, returning the other&#39;s
hand-grip. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m just looking round,&quot; said Anderson. &quot;I&#39;m just
looking round, and you&#39;ll admit it&#39;s worth the turning of
one&#39;s head. I shouldn&#39;t mind exchanging places with
Kamamura. It&#39;s not a bad life, his, by a long penny.
This affair will bang a hole through a good pile of ten
pun notes. They tell me those balloons made like dicky-birds
cost&mdash;I forget now, but it&#39;s a good pile of dollars
a-piece, for every feather is painted correct, and that&#39;s
just like the Japs&mdash;make a pretty thing, and then stick
it away in some hidey-hole where no one can see it, or
burn it&mdash;What&#39;s agate now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd was in motion, flooding towards a part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
the grounds where a little stage had been erected, backed
and half surrounded by cypress trees. On the stage,
against the dark-green background, could be seen the
graceful figure of a girl.</p>

<p class="indent">She was dancing. It was a dance that at first insipid,
became after a few moments fascinating, lulling, exquisite
to watch as the movements of a flower blown by
the wind.</p>

<p class="indent">They drew close and stood to look. The girl was
dressed in amber and scarlet, with a scarlet flower in the
night of her hair&mdash;a <i>bijou rose et noir</i>, recalling Baudelaire&#39;s
Lola de Vallence.</p>

<p class="indent">Her supple body seemed inspired by the mysterious
music we hear wandering through the land of spring,
and expressing itself in the voices of the wind and the
birds and the streams.</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to have learned her art in the academy
where the daffodils are taught to dance and the bluebells
to make their bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the Geisha Kamamura has hired&mdash;paid her something
like two hundred to dance that fan-dance, or whatever
they call it. She was a Tokyo girl, and had left
the business to get married, but she couldn&#39;t withstand
the two hundred; the best Geisha in Japan, they say.
What&#39;s this her name? O something San. Hoots! but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
my memory is gone fishing to-day. Listen! she&#39;s talking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The dance had ceased, and the girl, in the silence that
followed the tinkling of the three accompanying <i>cham&egrave;cens</i>,
had commenced one of those poetical recitals in
favor with an intellectual Japanese audience.</p>

<p class="indent">Her recitation was sad; it bemoaned the thing we call
change. The cherry-blossom is fair, ran this untranslatable
poem, but it must die and give place to the lotus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot understand this depression in trade,&quot; murmured
the muted voice of Anderson, as he stood beside
Leslie. &quot;It&#39;s been spreading and spreading, and there&#39;s
nothing it hasn&#39;t spread into.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the lotus parts with its petals to give place to the
chrysanthemum, the Royal chrysanthemum.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ve had a good year till now, ourselves, but hech!
man, there&#39;s a matter of fifteen thousand gone over the
breaking of the Bombay and Benares bank&mdash;clean gone,
never to come back&mdash;and that takes the sugar off the
cake&mdash;ay, the devil himself won&#39;t whistle it home again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the gray winter sky and the snowflakes, like
ghosts of flowers, finished the poem of the Geisha, whilst
Leslie stood transfixed for a second, frozen by the news
he had just heard, and unable to turn. He turned round
full on Anderson.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The breaking of <i>what</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
&quot;The Bombay and Benares. Have you not heard the
news? It came by cable to-day at one o&#39;clock. Good
God! man, you hadn&#39;t much money in it, had you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything&mdash;everything,&quot; said Leslie in a stammering voice.
&quot;I&#39;m smashed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He linked his arm in Anderson&#39;s, and dragged him
along hurriedly. He wanted to go, nowhere in particular,
but just get away from the spot where Anderson
had sentenced his future to death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man, I&#39;m sorry! Man, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; said his companion.
&quot;I should not have told you so sudden, but how
was I to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Smashed&mdash;smashed&mdash;smashed!&quot; said the other, talking
as a man talks in his sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">He held Anderson by the arm as he spoke. All around
spread the many-colored crowd; fans were fluttering,
umbrellas bobbing, tongues chattering, soft women&#39;s
voices inlaid like music of gold on the silvery music of
the fountains and cascades.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anderson, man, are you sure they&#39;ve broken&mdash;sure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, ay, sure. Better to tell you straight. Sure as
my name&#39;s James Anderson.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Boom! Boom! Boom! the band broke into a march
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
by Gungl, and Leslie, releasing Anderson, ran after a
figure in the crowd some twenty paces distant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane! I must speak to you at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked up from the little Japanese gentleman
who was escorting her, saw the distress in her countryman&#39;s
face, and dismissed Asia with a bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have just had frightful news. Come with me to
some quiet place till I tell you about it. Anywhere. No
matter where. See! there are no people across that
bridge where the trees are; let us go there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane spoke not a word, but he saw that she was very
pale and trembling. That weakness of Jane&#39;s gave him a
strange sensation. It said something that her lips had
never uttered.</p>

<p class="indent">They passed over the little bridge. They passed over
another bridge; there were no people here, only trees;
they went no further.</p>

<p class="indent">They were in a small forest. The garden was lost to
sight; only the music of the band, muted by distance,
told of the festivity so near, yet apparently so far away.</p>

<p class="indent">The trunk of a felled tree lay in the path; they sat
down upon it by common consent. Leslie took out his
watch, and looked at it attentively. Then, still holding
it open in his hand, he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
&quot;I want you to listen to me for five minutes&mdash;only
five minutes; you can hold the watch, and measure the
time yourself. Jane, when a man is going to be hanged,
they will give him a glass of brandy to help him along
to the drop. Will you do the same by me&mdash;give me five
minutes&#39; clear speech, and let me say just what I please
without interruption; will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, and she shivered as she spoke the
word. She had maintained a strange silence; impulsive as
she was, one might have expected her to implore him to
tell her the worst, and have it over. Perhaps she understood
dimly that Leslie&#39;s disaster was personal to herself,
a cataclysm the effect of which would reach her future
as well as his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember,&quot; he said, after a moment&#39;s pause,
&quot;how I asked you to marry me long ago, and everything
that happened after? Well, when I think of all that, it
seems to me that I must have passed through life in a
state of insanity, and only awakened to consciousness
now. Jane, I am feeling now as a man must feel when
he wakes in hell, and remembers&mdash;No matter, it is all
done with now; and even if you loved me as well as
I love you, it&#39;s all over and done with and useless
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned forward with his face in his hands. Jane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
did not speak; the music of the band had ceased, and the
only sound to be heard was the weary sighing of the
warm wind in the pine-tops.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m broken utterly, I have just heard the news.
Don&#39;t think I brought you here to listen to me whining
about my misfortunes. I brought you here to tell you I
love you. I meant to have carried you off in the steamer
that sails to-morrow morning for the north-west. With
the money I had yesterday, I would have supported you,
I would have torn you out of society, and made you
love me. I would have made you a Paradise. Yes, by the
living God, a Paradise, or there&#39;s no such thing as love.
But now I&#39;m a beggar, and I love you too well to drag
you into my ruin, and it&#39;s Fate, Fate, Fate that has
done it all, and cursed be its name!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again silence, broken only by a faint, dreary sound.
Jane was weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t, for the love of God!&quot; cried Leslie. &quot;Don&#39;t
cry, or you&#39;ll make me cry too. Oh, miserable life! why
was I ever born into it?&quot; And he moved his hands in
the air, as blind Samson might have done amidst the
pillars of the temple.</p>

<p class="indent">A bird piped three times in the recesses of the wood,
three flute-like notes sweet as the notes of a bell-bird.
They were answered by its mate in the branches above.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
Leslie put his hands to his ears, as if to shut out the
happy sounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane&#39;s tears had ceased, but she did not speak, she
did not breathe; only a deep sigh occasionally escaped
from her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, we can only say good-bye. Let us part
here for ever. We will meet again in&mdash;Heaven,&quot; said
Leslie, with a horrible shuddering laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">He stretched out his hand and took hers. She let him
have it without seeming to know that he had taken it.</p>

<p class="indent">She was murmuring his name in a whisper, staring at
him and through him, and as if her gaze was fixed on
some terrible catastrophe beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick! Dick! Dick!&quot; All poetry could not express
the helpless, hopeless sorrow she put into those three
little whispered words.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, filtering through the wood, came a sound,
a voice, a spirit, that unrolled around them a panorama
of loch, moor, and sky, hills purple with heather, lakes
dark with shadow. &quot;Auld Lang Syne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The band was playing it, villainously enough, but
the distance smoothed away the defects.</p>

<p class="indent">It broke Jane down. She leaned against his shoulder
and sobbed like a child, and then, with both hands upstretched,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
she drew his face down to hers and murmured&mdash;no
matter what.</p>

<p class="indent">Then all at once&mdash;heedless of ruin, forgetting all
things, carried away on the dumb tide of passion, the
wave that had retreated before disaster, only to come
shoreward again resistless and gigantic&mdash;all at once,
and without a word, he took her in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the eloquence of passion and despair, the speech
without tongue of a soul tormented and <i>in extremis</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">It broke Jane down utterly. Hopeless, haggard, and
pale as a person in the midst of some terrible disaster,
she clung to him, whispering in his ear words repeated
over and over again, with that reiteration which forms
the rhetoric of the dying and the lost.</p>

<p class="indent">She had cast everything aside, the world, her position
in society, her husband, her wealth. Passion and pity,
that strange combination, had for the moment blinded
her eyes to everything but the man beside her&mdash;but did
she love him? Fate had not yet disclosed the answer to
that old fatal question, that sphinx-like question whose
answer forms the plot of each man&#39;s story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="h2">THE FALSE REPORT</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Kamamura never again saw his two tall
English guests.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, they sought for and found a
means of leaving his garden by a back way that brought
them to a road which in its turn brought them to the
station.</p>

<p class="indent">And the native gentlefolk in the train, which brought
them back to Nagasaki by six o&#39;clock, could not imagine
what great grief it was that made the tall English lady
so pallid, and so like the very picture of woe.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Nagasaki station Leslie helped his companion
into a riksha.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t come back with me to the hotel,&quot; she murmured;
&quot;I will drive there alone. I want to be alone,
quite alone for a while. All our arrangements are made,
and there is nothing more to be said. God help me!&mdash;God
help us both! Good-bye, Dick, for the present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
He watched her drive off. Then he took a riksha himself,
and ordered the man to take him to the House of
the Clouds.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything was arranged. Jane was to be his for
ever. But there was no triumph in the thought. The
battle had been won by his own weakness, not by his
strength. Jane&#39;s compassion for him had betrayed her.</p>

<p class="indent">They were to sail to-morrow by the <i>Empress of
Japan</i>. He was to stay the night at the hotel, for he
could not possibly remain the night at the House of the
Clouds having once bidden good-bye to Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond Vancouver lay the scheme traced out by him,
accepted by Jane. They were to buy a farm in the
Canadian North-west, and live there for ever happily.
He would not touch a penny of her money; he had jewelry
worth at least four hundred pounds, which would
be amply sufficient to start on. His share in M&#39;Gourley&#39;s
business was to be left for Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true he knew little about farming, but&mdash;love can
do anything.</p>

<p class="indent">Viewed from a natural standpoint the whole arrangement
was not only natural but praiseworthy. That a
woman, fond of a natural life in the open air, should
leave a creature like George du Telle, and cast herself
into the arms of a man like Leslie. What could be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
in keeping with the grand aim of Nature, the propagation
of the fit in body?</p>

<p class="indent">Viewed from a social standpoint the whole arrangement
was wickedly absurd. And from a moral standpoint
simply wicked.</p>

<p class="indent">Nature stood decidedly on Leslie&#39;s side; God (according
to the theologians) and society stood against him.</p>

<p class="indent">These problems are occurring every day and every
minute of the day, perplexing the thinker and confounding
his belief, unless he looks upon the world as a higher
thing than a breeding ground for animals. And it is generally
by their side issues they are to be solved, and the
side issue in Leslie&#39;s case was Campanula.</p>

<p class="indent">He was nearing Danjuro&#39;s shop when he saw a riksha
with a disguised figure in it.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Mac, and Mac was disguised with whisky.</p>

<p class="indent">He was flushed, and his hat was on the back of his
head, and he was so obviously fuddled that the gentle
Japanese who passed smiled and passed on, without looking
back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot; cried Leslie to his man, then jumping out
he ran to M&#39;Gourley&#39;s riksha, which had also stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you heard the news?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;News?&quot; said Mac. &quot;News&mdash;what news?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Bombay and Benares bank is broken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
&quot;It is not,&quot; replied the other, fumbling in his pocket.
&quot;Na, na&mdash;false report. Bombay and Ta-Lien, you
mean.&quot; Then, drawing a paper from his pocket, and
with ferocity: &quot;Canna ye read?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie took the paper; it was a cablegram from
Shanghai.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;False report. Bombay and Ta-Lien suspended. Bombay
and Benares safe.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Jardine Matheson.</span>&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Heavens!&quot; said Leslie. &quot;When did you get
this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hoor ago. Drive on, you&mdash;wheel me awa&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mogi&mdash;to forget I was ever such a fule as to go into
partnership with a man like&mdash;<i>wheel me awa&#39;</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steady on, steady on,&quot; said Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be back the morrow morn and see y&#39; before
you&#39;re awa&#39; to Vancouver.&quot; Then, leaning back as the
riksha started: &quot;I may be a fule, but I&#39;m not a blind
fule, and I&#39;m not a&mdash;(<i>hic!</i>).&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The riksha joggled over a stone and he collapsed like
a shut-down opera hat.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie continued his way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="h2">FAREWELL</p>

<p class="indent">It was seven o&#39;clock; the birds were taking their nests
in the cherry orchard with one final burst of chattering.
The sky in the west, wave-green melting into
vaguest blue, held one solitary cloud floating like a rose-leaf
beneath the evening star. Leslie stood at his gate,
looking for the last time at the twilight stealing over
Nagasaki. He had just arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley&#39;s words were still ringing in his ears, and
his mind was in a turmoil.</p>

<p class="indent">He was in exactly the position of the man who has
cheated unwittingly at cards, who has found out his
mistake, and who has still time to save his honor.</p>

<p class="indent">If the Bombay and Benares bank was safe, it was his
plain duty to go at once to Jane du Telle and inform
her of the fact. She was laboring under the impression
that he was a ruined man. Half of her sympathy, the
whole of the present situation, had arisen from that misconception.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
To leave her under this delusion would
amount to fraud&mdash;the meanest of all frauds.</p>

<p class="indent">He was feeling this keenly, but unfortunately his
mind, instead of grappling with the situation, and forcing
his body to act, was engaged in cursing Fate, and the
tangled net in which he found himself taken.</p>

<p class="indent">Was it his fault that the false news had come just
at the psychological moment, the news that had actually
thrown Jane into his arms? He kept asking himself this,
as he gazed across the dusk-eyed harbor to the hills now
becoming dimmed by the twilight.</p>

<p class="indent">This last touch of Fate would, if he accepted it without
resistance, rob him of the last remnants of honor
and all self-respect.</p>

<p class="indent">His hand was upon the stakes, he had a moment to
decide whether to take them or leave them: to be a thief
or an honest man.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, as if silence had placed her finger upon
their throats, the birds in the orchard ceased their
chatter.</p>

<p class="indent">The warm day dying seemed to have called all the
spirits of beauty from air and earth and sea, to stain the
skies above its death-bed with the tints of the ocean and
the dawn. Over the tomb of light Color, Light&#39;s firstborn
child hovered like some exquisite ephemera whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
wings change from beauty to beauty before dissolving
for ever in darkness and death.</p>

<p class="indent">The silence that had come over the orchard was broken
occasionally by little outbursts of squabbling from over-full
nests, sounds like the flirting of a fan amongst the
leaves, chirrupings that told of differences made up.
Then final and complete silence that would last till night
woke the owls.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie at the gate suddenly made a gesture as if he
were flinging something away, turned on his heel, and
came towards the house.</p>

<p class="indent">He entered just as Cherry-blossom, with a white
flower in her hair, her amber sleeves fallen back and exposing
her fore-arms, her body stretched to its fullest
height on the tips of her tabis, was in the act of lighting
the big hall-lamp. She looked like a little cat stretching
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">A pang went through his heart. He would never see
Cherry-blossom light the big hall-lamp again, never
again see Pine-breeze bring in the tea-cups, nor Lotus-bud
carrying off Sweetbriar San to his box in the
kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">You cannot possibly live in Japan without loving your
maid-servants. I mean by love that sort of passion which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
was inspired in Matthew Prior by the lady of fashion
aged five.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a feature of the House of the Clouds that
sometimes on the lower floor you would find a hall with
two rooms on either side of it, and sometimes two rooms
and no hall, and sometimes, in very hot weather, one
huge room. The sliding paper partitions made this possible;
nay, very easy, for Mr. Initogo had improved
upon the ordinary Japanese method, being of an inventive
turn of mind.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked into the room on the right of the hall. A
<i>cham&egrave;cen</i> lay on the floor, an hibachi showed a crimson
spark, and a dwarf maple in a pot of Arita ware displayed
its pretty form vaguely in the twilight.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked into the room on the left: no one.</p>

<p class="indent">Where was Campanula? She must have returned by
this, surely. Perhaps she was upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">He went up, making little noise in his stocking-feet.
At the door of his room he peeped in.</p>

<p class="indent">There was Campanula. Oh, desolate sight! She was
sitting on his big portmanteau all alone in the dusk.
Her head was bent.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked so forlorn and so small, and the sash of
her obi so huge in comparison with the wearer, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
could not but recall how she sat that morning in the
Tea House of the Tortoise. That morning, when she
had likened herself to a lump of mud; the morning he
had proposed to adopt her, and care for her, and make
her a chattel of his own.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later, he had caught her up in his arms.
She did not resist, but he seemed to have taken up a lifeless
thing.</p>

<p class="indent">As he carried her downstairs, had he known, it might
have seemed strange to him that so great a grief should
be so light a burden.</p>

<p class="indent">He brought her to the room on the right, where
Cherry-blossom had just lit the lamp, and sat down beside
her on the matting.</p>

<p class="indent">He took a cigarette from his pocket, and approached
the tobacco-mono with it. Then, without lighting it, he
flung the cigarette away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Campanula, I am going on a journey. I did not
tell you last night, for I had not made up my mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have heard it,&quot; she replied. She sat there beside
him, a small figure with head bowed and hands folded in
her lap; and the sadness and sorrowful sweetness of those
four words pierced his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">To get this terrible interview over, to tear himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
away at once, he would have sold years of his life. But
it had to be gone through with.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether she loved him as a woman loves a man, or a
child loves a father, she loved him, loved him as no person
had ever loved him before&mdash;and he knew it.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he talked to her, telling her that he would come
back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been away before, Campanula, and I have
returned. Will you not believe me that I will return?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah yes,&quot; she answered, &quot;but you did not go with
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He said nothing for a moment. There was a sound
outside; it was the coolie he had ordered to take his portmanteau
to the hotel. He heard Pine-breeze accosting
him, he heard him go upstairs and come down again,
walking heavily. It was like the sound of a man carrying
out a coffin.</p>

<p class="indent">He heard his steps on the garden walk dying towards
the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">How had she discovered with whom he was going?</p>

<p class="indent">If she would only weep or cry out, or move, or break
in some way this terrible stillness. If she would only
reproach him. But she said nothing, nor even sighed.
She seemed like a person stricken not by grief, but death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
Then he began to talk again, telling her of the arrangements
he had made. How M&#39;Gourley San would look
after her, just as he had done before, till he came back.
And he would write every week&mdash;till he came back.
And they would all be happy together again, as happy
as ever they had been&mdash;when he came back.</p>

<p class="indent">To which she replied:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are going away to find happiness, my happiness is great.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fancy a white house, lantern-lit, and steeped in dusk,
a tall man walking away from it rapidly, three Mousm&egrave;s
on their knees on the veranda crying after the vanishing
form: &quot;Come again, oh, condescend to come
again quickly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of their voices rings in his ears as he passes
through the little gate. He hears it pursuing him like
the faint murmur of bees, until a puff of wind blows it
away and replaces it by the faint sound of the city below.</p>

<p class="indent">Come again! He will never come again to lie in the
hammock beneath the cherry trees. Never more shall
Lotus-bud hand him the night lantern to light him to
his bed, nor thy small hands, O Pine-breeze, bear him

to smell!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
As he came down hill towards Nagasaki he felt as
though he were leaving spring for ever behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">Thrice he stopped as if to return, and stood gazing
into the darkness of the uphill path, listening to the wind
in the branches of the lilac trees.</p>

<p class="indent">The last of these pauses ended more abruptly than the
others, and he plunged on again down hill through the
gloom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="h2">HER HOUSE IN ORDER</p>

<p class="indent">Left alone, Campanula sat, her hands folded in
her lap&mdash;a Lost One indeed.</p>

<p class="indent">Before her mental vision, beyond Japan, beyond that
desolate country always surrounded with ice, the country
where the bluebells grew&mdash;beyond all this lay the
land where O Toku San had gone that day, the land
where one never regrets, one never forgets, one never
remembers.</p>

<p class="indent">He had gone to find happiness. Not one word had
she spoken to hold him back or keep him by her, this
true daughter of Dai Nippon, soul sister of O Gozen
San, daughter in spirit of the immortal Hirose.</p>

<p class="indent">Cleopatra with the asp and all the mouthing heroines
of history would seem cheap indeed beside this small and
faithful figure to whom death was nothing, passion and
personal happiness nothing beside the happiness of the
being she loved.</p>

<p class="indent">She sat for an hour scarce moving; then she rose up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
She had no more time for personal thoughts; all things
had to be left in order, and her trust to the least detail
faithfully fulfilled.</p>

<p class="indent">She called the Mousm&egrave;s to her, and told them that
now Leslie San had left, they would be discharged until
he came back. They could go that evening to their
homes in the city below. She would pay them their
wages and a month in advance, and a little present for
each out of money of her own. And the three kow-towed,
delighted at the prospect of change and the
month&#39;s money for doing nothing, and the little present
besides. They never thought to ask her what she would
do herself in the house alone, their butterfly brains were
so filled with the thoughts of pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she made Lotus-bud bring all the bills owing,
bills yard long and extraordinarily minute in detail.
These she discharged. There were chits out, but these
were Leslie&#39;s affair, and he had no doubt settled them.</p>

<p class="indent">She thought of Sweetbriar San the cat, and as he was
fondest of Pine-breeze, she gave Pine-breeze a small sum
to take him home and keep him, applying to M&#39;Gourley
San if more money were needful.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she went upstairs to her own room and folded
neatly the obis and kimonos in the drawers of the great
lacquer cabinet. In one of these drawers were things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
she had only, as it were, dropped from her hand; the
toys she had played with as a child. Here was the doll
bought in Nikko, and bouncing balls, ever so many; and
in a piece of rice paper, still ferocious, but terribly old
and warped, the famous dragon.</p>

<p class="indent">She took him out and tried to remove the paper from
his sugar-candy sides, but it was stuck too tight. She
put him back, and, holding the drawer with both hands,
pressed her forehead against them.</p>

<p class="indent">As she stood like this, mute and utterly motionless,
the night breeze came through the window, bearing the
perfume of the azaleas.</p>

<p class="indent">It was as if they were calling to her, and she closed
the drawer gently and turned, as if to say, &quot;I hear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she came down and found the three Mousm&egrave;s
waiting, each with a lighted lamp on the end of a stick,
and her frail belongings on her back, luggage consisting
of cardboard boxes, except in the case of Pine-breeze,
who was also burdened with a basket containing Sweetbriar
San.</p>

<p class="indent">They had received their wages, and there was nothing
left for them now to do but go; which they did, after
profound salaams, murmurs and declarations of personal
unworthiness.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Campanula found herself standing alone. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
only living thing beside herself in the house was the
mushi, that musician of the night, already saluting its
mistress with a thin stream of song. She went to the
doorway where it hung, and unhooked the little cage.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE &quot;LA FRANCE&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fair that had been going on all day in the street
leading to the Bund was still in full swing. A
lurid sight the street presented, lit by lanterns of all colors,
and flare lamps near the booths.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie was glad of the noise and bustle around him;
one cannot think much when pressing one&#39;s way through
a Japanese fair, colored lamps dancing, Mousm&egrave;s laughing,
and showmen shouting, rikshas passing at a trot, or
attempting so to do, children blowing trumpets, babies
whirling rattles, men-of-war&#39;s men from the ships in
harbor walking four abreast and arm in arm, singing
&quot;Jean Francis de Nantes,&quot; or &quot;We won&#39;t go Home
till Morning.&quot; <i>Cham&egrave;cens</i> and moon fiddles buzzing
and tinkling, dogs barking, and gakunin wailing.</p>

<p class="indent">It was ten when he reached the hotel. In the entrance-hall,
where the orange trees in tubs reflected the
lamp-light from their glossy leaves, a Chinese hall porter
in a blue silk blouse sat on guard. From the half-open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
door of the <i>salle &agrave; manger</i>, where a party of Russian
officers were at dinner, came the sound of laughter
and the clinking of glasses.</p>

<p class="indent">As he entered the hotel the whole world around him
changed. Campanula vanished from his mind. He was
no longer in Japan. He was in the same house with
Jane, and in a few more hours she would be his.</p>

<p class="indent">The Chinaman rose from his seat when he saw Leslie
enter and led him down a corridor to the door of the private
sitting-room where he had dined with Du Telles.
He had promised Jane to wait for her there till the
morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The sphinx-like Celestial closed the door, and Leslie
found himself alone.</p>

<p class="indent">The windows were open on account of the warmth,
and they gave a view of the narrow mysterious harbor
that seems to have been cut in the old heroic days by
some giant who was also a poet. The high cliffs cast
their shadows like sable robes upon the water, jeweled
with the lights of the shipping. The sky all silence and
stars, paling now in the moonlight, was almost the sky
of Europe. Orion was there, and the Pleiades, and Cassiop&aelig;a
dreaming in her diamond-studded chair.</p>

<p class="indent">The room itself was a strange mixture of Japan and
Europe. The floor was the matted floor of Japan, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
cane sofas might have been bought at Shoolbred&#39;s. The
walls were as plain and unadorned as the walls of a
Japanese house are wont to be&mdash;that is to say, under
the fans which the hotel proprietor had fastened to them&mdash;fans
from Kioto, Tokyo, and Nara crucified against
the white paneling and looking like great butterflies in
some giant&#39;s collection.</p>

<p class="indent">He lit a pipe. Jane was upstairs in some room, but
there were still nine hours of waiting to be done; and he
had promised that he would not go upstairs if permitted
to pass the night in the hotel, but wait patiently for
her to come to him at the hour of starting.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt that if he thought about her he would break
his oath, so he drove her from his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">He watched the twinkling lights in the harbor; those
darting about like fire-flies were the sampans; that long
hulk all crusted with light was the <i>La France</i>, the ship
in which Jane had intended to sail for Osaka. It was
after ten now, and she was overdue to leave. That sister-hulk,
equally gemmed, was the Nord Deutscher Lloyd
boat leaving at dawn for Colombo. Those three lights
in a triangle were the anchor lights of the great Russian
cruiser <i>Rurik</i>&mdash;the ill-fated <i>Rurik</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly a horn of light shot out from the bow of
the <i>La France</i>, and she began to move like a glittering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
town towards the sea, and the wind from the west
brought the faint music of a band. The <i>La France</i>
had unbuoyed and was away.</p>

<p class="indent">He watched her as she picked her course through the
shipping stealthily like a robber. Now with all side
lights showing, now with them half extinguished as she
veered to avoid the bell-buoy of the Atraska shoal; now
a vague phantom swallowed by the shadows of the night.</p>

<p class="indent">The hotel was silent now, the Russians had gone off
to their ship. Somewhere outside, somewhere in the
gloom of the mysterious night, a <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> was tinkling
to the muttering of a little drum. What dancing girl
was setting her steps to that tune&mdash;and where?</p>

<p class="indent">He rose to his feet and began to pace the room, then
he turned the lamp up till it smoked, and turned it down
till it was nearly out, and cursed the burner for his own
stupidity.</p>

<p class="indent">Still the distant <i>cham&egrave;cen</i> kept up its buzzing to the
devil&#39;s tattoo of the distant drum.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked to the window and shut it. Result&mdash;absolute
silence and stifling heat. No matter; anything
was better than that infernal drum.</p>

<p class="indent">He had shut out the drum, but he had shut in a mosquito.
It was in the lace curtain, and its twang brought
him again to his feet. He tried to find it in the curtain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
failed, pulled the whole curtain down from its attachment,
and trampled it under-foot.</p>

<p class="indent">Silence, this time unbroken, until one of the fans upon
the wall rustled, and from beneath it crept a frightful-looking
spider as brown and as broad as a penny.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not see it; he was sitting in the arm-chair with
his head between his hands, breaking his promise to Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">When it was broken he got up, crossed the room,
opened the door, and went into the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">The Chinese night-porter was sitting like a figure of
stone in a blouse of blue silk. Leslie went up to him,
spoke some words in a low tone, and handed him some
money.</p>

<p class="indent">The Chinaman rose and led the way upstairs. Down
a passage they went till the guide stopped, pointed to a
door, turned, and vanished as silently as he had come.</p>

<p class="indent">Leslie went to the door and knocked softly. No answer.
He turned the handle, the door opened and he
entered&mdash;an empty room.</p>

<p class="indent">A lamp was burning on a table in one corner, a bed
stood close to the window: the bed was empty.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Jane&#39;s room, for there lay her trunks. A glove
lay on the floor. He picked it up, looked at it, smelt it,
and then threw it down. The dressing-table held none
of those articles of the toilet one might have expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
to see. Beside the lamp on the side-table lay a letter.</p>

<p class="indent">He had seen the letter almost on the first moment of
his entering the room, with that vague, half-terrified
comprehension which we may imagine in the brain of the
bull when the sun-light flashes on the sword of the matadore.</p>

<p class="indent">He approached it now, and read the superscription:
&quot;Richard Leslie, Esq. Important.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He opened it, and a number of bank notes came out.
These he laid on one side, took the letter that was with
them, and began to read.</p>

<p class="indent">He read the letter, not as if he were reading a letter,
but the face of some scoundrel he had dragged by the
ears into the zone of lamplight. He envisaged it, took
whole sentences in <i>en bloc</i>. He read first at the end, then
in the middle, then at the beginning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now good-bye for ever. Oh, Dick, don&#39;t think
badly of me for this; I have only done what was right.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you get this I shall be gone. I am leaving
by the <i>La France</i> to meet George.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I leave you money. Half what I have is yours; remember
we are cousins, and ought to help one another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Dick! Dick! I <i>can&#39;t</i> do what you want. I am
not thinking of myself but of my people. Imagine the
disgrace and ruin it would bring them. My dear old
father, it would kill him.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="h2">AMIDST THE AZALEAS</p>

<p class="indent">It was very late at night; clouds from the Pacific were
rolling over Nagasaki, and it was evident that the
hot weather of the last two days had been the prelude of
a storm.</p>

<p class="indent">The House of the Clouds, lamp-lit and deserted, cast
from the opening in the shoji a long parallelogram of
light that cut the darkness like a sword; a sword of light
lying upon the veranda, the graveled walk, and the landscape
garden.</p>

<p class="indent">With the darkness outside had come a great silence
broken only by the wind.</p>

<p class="indent">Had you been standing on the veranda you would
have sworn that some blind person was prowling before
the house, soundless of foot and cautiously feeling his
way by tapping on the ground with a stick.</p>

<p class="indent">It was only the lath shaken by the wind, the tireless
lath that all day and all the night before had kept the
echoes of the garden answering its summons, and still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
kept up the unwearied sound-semblance of a blind man
who walked without footstep, a patient sentinel, now advancing,
now retreating, now at the garden gate, now
near the azaleas, and ever waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">The garden gate clicked, and hurried footsteps came
up the path.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Leslie, hatless, bright and wild of eye, walking
rapidly, but in a tottering manner. His lips were of a
dull purple color, and he had the aspect of a man heavily
drugged with opium.</p>

<p class="indent">He crossed the veranda and entered the deserted hall.
He looked into the rooms on either side&mdash;they were
both empty. Then he came back to the hall, and cried
out, &quot;Campanula!&quot; The rafters returned the sound of
his voice, but she did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">He was perfectly clear of mind, but his breathing was
affected, and a deadly torpor hung over him which his
will alone prevented falling.</p>

<p class="indent">He took in all the details around him with extraordinary
clearness, amongst others the fact that the mushi&#39;s
cage had been removed.</p>

<p class="indent">Having waited for a moment, straining his ears to
catch the faintest sound, he seized the swinging paper
lantern that lit the hall, and with it in his hand went into
the kitchen. It was deserted. Then he went upstairs&mdash;every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
room was empty. It was like a house from which
the people had fled in terror, and he came down again,
wild with the apprehension of some unknown tragedy.</p>

<p class="indent">He brought the lamp into the room on the right of
the passage, and placed it on the floor. Something crimson
lay on the primrose-colored matting. He picked
it up; it was Campanula&#39;s obi. Why had she cast it
there?</p>

<p class="indent">He was looking round him as if for a person to explain
all these things, when his eye caught an open
drawer of the great lacquer cabinet that contained his
papers. He looked into the drawer, and it was empty.
It was the drawer in which he had placed the waki-zashi&mdash;the
suicide sword, given to him by Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">From the open drawer his eyes turned to the obi, which
he had dropped, and then he looked round him, as Dives
looks round him in that picture of Teniers, where Dives
wakes in Hell.</p>

<p class="indent">As he stood, the wind shook the broken lath outside,
and played with it. &quot;Tap! tap! tap!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He saw the sunlit Nikko road, the valley of the crimson
azaleas, the Lost One who had loved him as no other
being had loved him&mdash;the one he had lost for ever.</p>

<p class="indent">She was dead, yet it was denied to him to find her, and
clasp her in his arms, and die with her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
Death was nothing, but never to find her again, never
to see her again, or touch her small body, that was an
agony far beyond death.</p>

<p class="indent">He left the room, feeling by the walls like a man without
sight.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside, the world was in utter darkness. More clouds
had rolled up over the sky, as if called by the Blind One,
the tapping of whose stick betrayed him, as he walked,
waiting for his prey.</p>

<p class="indent">If he could find her, what cared he for the Blind One!
If he could not find her he felt that he would be for ever
lost. But he could never find her more, for the opium
sleep was falling upon him now. He had no more
strength to fight it, and the darkness of the pit lay
around him.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, the night wind changed, and brought him
the perfume of the unseen azaleas, and with the perfume
a thin thread of song.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the song of the mushi&mdash;the atom of life he
had spared that day in his fury, even as God might
now be sparing him&mdash;the mushi she had loved so well.
Feeling by the veranda wall, he followed the song like
a man led by a thread, and as he came he crushed something
beneath his foot: it was the lath, whose sound
would never trouble him again.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
He felt the azalea bushes around his knees, and advanced
amongst them, still led by the tremulous song,
till his foot touched something soft, and his hand a tiny
cage, hanging to one of the crimson-flowering boughs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p class="h2">BON MATSURI</p>

<p class="indent">It was the 18th of August&mdash;the last night of Bon
Matsuri.</p>

<p class="indent">Under a sky splendid with stars, the hills about Nagasaki
were gemmed with colored lights. Ten thousand
colored lanterns adorned the terraced cemeteries, and towards
dawn each lantern would be fixed to a tiny boat of
straw, freighted with a few small coins, and some small
offering of fruit, to stay the souls of the dead on their
long journey home.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley had come out to see the fairy-like spectacle,
for he knew that Mr. Initogo, that faithful old Pagan
gentleman, was amidst the rejoicers on the hillsides, and
had lit two lanterns, and freighted two small boats, for
the souls of two friends he had known on earth.</p>

<p class="indent">Just as the morning breeze began to blow, and before
the first star had paled in the dawn breaking over the
Pacific, the gazers from the ships and the shore drew
their breath, for suddenly the whole hillsides seemed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
motion, shifting and glittering down to the water&#39;s edge,
till the ripples became surrounded by a zone of rose-colored
fire.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the water itself became dyed with the glow of
ten thousand lanterns, each bravely upborne on its little
ship of straw, whose sails took the Eastern breeze.</p>

<p class="indent">As the fairy flotilla sailed away, spreading the harbor
with light and color, ship after ship took fire, and
ship after ship was lost.</p>

<p class="indent">M&#39;Gourley, hat in hand, stood watching till the last
spark had vanished in the lilac of the dawn; then, with a
sigh that spoke of things that were not, but might have
been, he turned slowly home.</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
